<div class="zn-body__paragraph">May said it would be down to her successor to find consensus where she could not, and urged all sides to compromise. </div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold -- the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last," May said. </div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love," she said, bursting into tears as she left the lectern and walked back into Number 10. </div>

div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">May was forced into making Friday's announcement after losing the support of her Cabinet, many of whom were fed up with the ongoing turmoil over Brexit.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">The last straw for Cabinet ministers appears to have been the latest version of May's Brexit plan, which she unveiled on Tuesday. In an attempt to win over opposition lawmakers, May offered the House of Commons the chance to vote on a second referendum -- a concession that was bitterly opposed by some senior members of her government.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Her fate was sealed by the leadership of the 1922 Committee -- which represents the interests of rank-and-file lawmakers in May's Conservative Party -- who threatened to change party rules to allow a vote of no-confidence. May survived an earlier confidence vote in December last year, and under current rules was immune to challenge for another year. </div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">May's announcement will set off a frantic race to succeed her. One leading candidate is Boris Johnson, the wily former Foreign Secretary who commands significant support among grassroots members of the party.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Johnson has bitterly opposed the withdrawal deal that May negotiated with the EU, and resigned from her Cabinet over it. On Friday, he described May's statement as "dignified" and said "it is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit."</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">A number of May's Cabinet members, including potential candidates in the race to replace her, paid their tributes on Twitter. </div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Amber Rudd, who serves as Work and Pensions Secretary, praised May's "great courage," while <a href="https://twitter.com/sajidjavid" target="_blank">Home Secretary Sajid Javid</a> said no one had "a greater sense of public duty than the Prime Minister." </div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Prominent Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom, who resigned <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/22/uk/andrea-leadsom-resigns-gbr-intl/index.html" target="_blank">as Leader of the House of Commons </a>on Wednesday, said May's speech illustrated "her total commitment to country and duty." </div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">But it's unclear whether the next Prime Minister will have any luck reopening the deal, which Brussels has insisted is locked down. May's successor will face the same deadlocked House of Commons, which has repeatedly rejected her plan but failed to vote in favor of any kind of alternative. </div>

<div class="zn-body__paragraph">That may raise the prospect of a new Conservative leader calling a general election in an attempt to break the impasse.<strong> </strong></div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">UK opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn jumped at the prospect after May's speech, tweeting: "Whoever becomes the new Tory leader must let the people decide our country's future, through an immediate General Election."</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">Some pro-Remain politicians expressed concern that a Brexiteer could soon take May's place and push Britain towards a hard Brexit.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">"The prospect of an even more hardline Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning," Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter. </div>

div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">May's decision to step down is an inglorious end for a Prime Minister who was ushered into office on the back of the Brexit vote, promising to deliver on the results of the referendum.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">But the deal that resulted from a tortuous set of negotiations with the EU was rejected three times by the House of Commons.</div>

div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">On Tuesday, in an attempt to repackage the plan, May rolled it up into a wider set of legislation dealing with Britain's departure. As well as the offer of a second referendum, it also contained pledges on workers' rights, environmental provisions, as well as a temporary customs relationship with the European Union.</div>
div
<div class="zn-body__paragraph">But her "new Brexit deal" was greeted with significant opposition from across the political spectrum. Hardline Conservatives who had supported May's last deal, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs who prop up May's minority government in Parliament and supporters of a second referendum alike all rejected it.</div>
