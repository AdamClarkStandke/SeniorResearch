A federal court in Mississippi on Friday temporarily blocked the state's new "fetal heartbeat" law that bans abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. The law was set to take effect July 1.

“Here we go again," U.S. District Judge Carlton W. Reeves wrote in his opinion. "Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.”
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Mississippi is one of ten states to push through a law restricting access to abortion in 2019, though all of those laws have faced lawsuits that challenge their constitutionality and none of them are in effect. Georgia, Ohio and Kentucky have passed bans similar to Mississippi's, and earlier on Friday, Missouri's governor signed a new eight-week ban. Alabama passed a law that would criminalize abortion for doctors who perform them, while Utah and Arkansas have pushed through legislation that would ban the most common form of second-trimester abortions.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The judge went on to say that Mississippi's law, which was passed in March, “prevents a woman’s free choice, which is central to personal dignity and autonomy.”</p>

It also accuses Griffiths of treating the "rebels as a de-facto government and as an equal to the legitimate and elected government" of Yemen.</p>






<div data-embed-type="teads"></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
The conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the Shiite Houthi rebels. A Saudi-led coalition allied with Hadi's government has been fighting the Houthis since March 2015. The fighting in the Arab world's poorest country has killed an estimated 60,000 people and left millions suffering from lack of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/Food" id="_ap_link_food_Food_" target="_blank">food</a> and medical care.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Also on Friday, security officials in Houthi-controlled territory said a Saudi-led air raid killed eight civilians and wounded at least four in the southwestern province of Taiz. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of their safety, said the attack took place Friday in Mawya district.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Mohamed Abdel Salam, spokesman for the Houthis, condemned the attack.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Tensions arose between Griffiths and Hadi last week after the U.N. announced the long-delayed Houthi withdrawal from the flashpoint port city of Hodeida.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Hadi's government accused Griffiths at the time of turning a blind eye that the rebels had allegedly only handed control of the port to "militia leaders" loyal to them. The "redeployment of Houthis" from Hodeida was part of a U.N.-brokered deal concluded in December.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Hadi went on to say that Griffiths' "poor understanding" of the Yemeni conflict makes him unfit for his post.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
While briefing the U.N. Security Council on the situation in Yemen last week, Griffiths urged the warring sides to maintain the momentum of the Houthi withdrawal from Hodeida — the country's lifeline to foreign aid — and to work urgently on a political solution to the devastating conflict.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
There were "signs of hope" but "also alarming signs" that could threaten progress, Griffiths said, a reference to continuing clashes in the southern Dhale province.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Later on Friday, Houthi rebel leader Mohamed Ali al-Houthi tweeted that Hadi's letter to the U.N. chief was "a miserable attempt to curtail peace."</p>

Sears allegedly spoke to Mathieu on the phone in late April and demanded the NFL star deposit $1.5 million in the suspect's bank account by the end of the week, according to the complaint. Mathieu refused and blocked Sears from being able to contact him by phone.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
But a day after being blocked, the suspect allegedly contacted a friend of Mathieu and said in a text, "5 MILLION BY FRIDAY IM DONE TALKING EMAILING TMZ NOW." He also provided his bank account information so Mathieu, or his associates, could deposit the money, according to court documents.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Sears then allegedly went as far as to send Mathieu's friends a voice message saying, "I want 1.5 million by Friday or I am going to kill all you all."</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Mathieu told police he feared for his and his family's safety and believed Sears was capable of violence, according to the document.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The suspect then spoke to Mathieu's agent by telephone and said he would "injure TM's reputation by alleging sexual misconduct" if he didn't receive the money.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
Sears was initially expected to make a first court appearance in Louisiana, where he lives, on Thursday, but his lawyer successfully petitioned for 30 more days to review evidence in the case.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
He will appear in court on June 21.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Sears was released on $25,000 bond and ordered to have no contact with Mathieu or his associates, in person or via social media, cellphone or computer. He is being held on home incarceration and with a monitoring device, according to the court order.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
Mathieu struggled with disciplinary issues while at Louisiana State University, but his play on the field was electric as both a freshman and sophomore. As a sophomore he was named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the best college player in the nation each year.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
But following the 2011-12 season, the star was dismissed from the team by head coach Les Miles. While the reason was never released by the school, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2013/story/_/id/9163715/tyrann-mathieu-disputes-report-saying-told-nfl-team-failed-more-drug-tests-remember" target="_blank">ESPN reported</a> that he had failed multiple drug tests. Mathieu enrolled back in LSU that fall as only a student, but was <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/8552111/tyrann-mathieu-former-lsu-tigers-cornerback-arrested-drug-charges" target="_blank">arrested for drug possession</a> in October 2012 and declared for the NFL draft a month later.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
Mathieu was drafted in the third round due to concerns about his behavior, but quickly became one of the best safeties in the league paired with his former college teammate Patrick Peterson. He made the All-Rookie team in 2013 and was a first-team All Pro in 2015. He signed a five-year, $62 million deal following that season, but was injured in 2016 and released by Arizona in 2018.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
He played one season with the Houston Texans before <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26232854/mathieu-join-chiefs-3-years-42m" target="_blank">signing with the Chiefs</a> this offseason for three years and $42 million.

Prosecutors said parenting guru Jane Buckingham paid Singer $50,000 to have Mark Riddell take the ACT on behalf of her son.

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The proposal by the Health and Human Services Department, subject to a 60-day public comment period before becoming final, has alarmed advocacy groups that say they are worried transgender patients, in particular, could be denied care, particularly in less populated areas where services can be scarce.
</p>


<div class="teads-adCall"></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Roger Severino, director of the HHS office for civil rights, said the 2016 rule had to be addressed because of a court injunction. He also cited the cost burden of enforcing the regulations.</p>


<div class="t_callout"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/states-restricting-abortion-move-bolster-access/story?id=63101961" target="_blank">(MORE: While some states are restricting abortion, others move to bolster access)</a></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
He said the new rule wouldn't preempt state regulations and it wouldn't urge medical providers not to treat certain patients.
</p>






<div data-embed-type="teads"></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Other anti-discrimination protections, applied to such groups as race, sex and religion, would remain intact.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
"We have a lot of diversity for health care, We have a lot of options for people," Severino told reporters on Friday. "This rule does not go in and tell people how to practice medicine."
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
The move reflects the Trump administration's position that discrimination on the basis of sex shouldn't include gender identity. The administration has taken several steps to roll back or limit rights for LGBTQ people, including a restriction on transgender people serving in the military.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Most recently a rule announced by Housing and Urban Development Department that would allow federally funded shelters to turn away people citing religious objections and force transgender women to use men's bathrooms. Secretary Ben Carson defended the move Friday in a statement to ABC News: "our intention is to stop treating sex and self-identified gender as the same because I believe Washington shouldn’t be telling the rest of America how to determine whether someone is a man or a woman.”</p>


<div class="t_callout"><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/outrage-wake-rampant-anti-transgender-murders-activists/story?id=63172530" target="_blank">(MORE: Not enough 'outrage' in wake of rampant anti-transgender murders: Activists)</a></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Overall, the administration has moved to expand protections for businesses, including health care workers, to deny services if they feel it conflict with their religious beliefs. HHS had proposed changing the requirements for family planning clinics that accept federal money; that plan has been put on hold by a federal judge.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
Advocacy groups were expected to challenge the proposal in court.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
Winnie Stachelberg, executive vice president for external affairs at the Center for American Progress, in a statement, called the proposal an "unfair, targeted attack to marginalize certain patients" and said the administration can't "turn back the clock" on civil rights protections.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
"By diluting and weakening protections from discrimination, patients may get turned away or denied medically necessary care simply because of who they are," Stachelberg said.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The latest proposal would alter the government's definition of "Section 1557," which is the non-discrimination of the Affordable Care Act. The Obama administration had issued a 2016 rule that expanded the class of people protected against discrimination to include gender identity.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The Obama rule also prohibited discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, to include "termination of pregnancy, or recovery" from such a procedure.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
When asked what problems the administration was trying to fix with the rule, Serevino cited the money spent to enforce the regulation.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
"It was clear there was no sufficient evidence for the imposition of $3.2 billion in cost," he told reporters, noting another $400 million that will cost to "lift the regulatory burden."

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The Kabul neighborhood where the bombing took place is dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, most of whom are Sunni Muslims and who make up the backbone of the Taliban movement.</p>






<div data-embed-type="teads"></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Meanwhile, a car bombing wounded 12 people late on Thursday in the southern city of Kandahar. Provincial council member Yousaf Younasi said the bombing targeted insurgents from neighboring Pakistan's secessionist Baluchistan Liberation Army.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
It was the second attack in recent years to target the group in Kandahar's posh Aino Mina residential area, he said. Last year, a suicide bomber blew himself up there, killing five Baluch separatists, including the mastermind behind the attack last November on the Chinese Consulate in Pakistan's port city of Karachi that killed four people — two police officials and two civilians.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Pakistan has struggled with the years-long insurgency in Baluchistan where the separatists demand a greater share of the region's wealth and autonomy from Islamabad. The separatist group also claimed responsibility for an attack earlier this month on a luxury hotel in the Pakistani port city of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea. Most of the residents in the hotel were Chinese nationals involved in the development of the port.</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
Kandahar's provincial police chief, Tadin Khan, said there was no evidence that Baluch insurgents were the target of the explosion, which he said also wounded four children.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) is denying allegations of gender discrimination after the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-womens-national-team-sues-soccers-governing-body/story?id=61558748" target="_blank"> women's national soccer team</a> claimed unfair treatment in a lawsuit.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
"U.S. Soccer's challenged pay practices are not based on sex," according to a response from USSF filed Tuesday in federal court. Rather, "any alleged pay differential" is due to "differences in the aggregate revenue generated by the different teams" and other factors, the response said.</p>


<div class="teads-adCall"></div>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) suit alleged female players were treated unfairly on the field and in pay versus the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT), which is less successful in competition.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The USSF, which also rejected the suit's call for class action status, attributed the differences in treatment, including why women flew commercial while men traveled on chartered planes, to differences between the teams.</p>

<div data-embed-type="teads"></div>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
"The USWNT and USMNT play at different times, in different locations, against different opponents, and are comprised of athletes who have different obligations, are compensated in fundamentally different ways, and enjoy different benefits; thus, USWNT players have no male 'counterparts' who play for the USMNT," the response said.
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
A spokesperson for the suing USWNT athletes told ABC News in a statement, "There is no legal basis for USSF's claim that it is anything other than a single employer operating both the men's and women's teams -- who face drastically unequal conditions and pay under their shared employer."</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
The USSF claims the players on each team "receive fundamentally different pay structures for performing different work under their separate collective bargaining agreements."
</p>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
The men fall under a "pay-for-play" structure and are "only paid for individual match appearances" on tournament or tournament-qualifying rosters, the organization said, arguing male players' compensation cannot be compared to the women "who earn guaranteed salaries and benefits."</p>


<blockquote class="t_pullquote t_pullquote_centerAlign"><div class="block_dbl_left">“</div><div class="block_dbl_right">”</div>Even as the most decorated American soccer team in history, USSF treats the women's team as 'less-than' equal compared to their male colleagues.</blockquote>






<p itemprop="articleBody">
The USWNT "consistently rejected all proposals" for a pay-for-play structure, USSF said.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The players' statement said in response, "The USSF cannot justify its violation of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII by pointing to the teams’ separate collective bargaining agreements or any factor other than sex."
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
USSF added that the "total prize money available" in the 2018 Men's World Cup was $38 million compared to the $2 million for the last Women's World Cup, which took place in 2015.
</p>


<p itemprop="articleBody">
The USSF also said the women's team makes less revenue from game ticket sales, although it noted that it "invested in marketing and promoting the USWNT."</p>

The organization did, however, admit "the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup final match broke the record for being the most watched soccer match shown on English-language television in this country" and "that the USWNT's 2015 Victory Tour drew tens of thousands of fans to stadiums across the United States."
