<p class="speakable">So, yeah, this kid?</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">She’s apparently got a problem when it’s her kid sister’s birthday.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<p>And honestly… it’s sorta understandable.</p>


<p>I mean – who really especially likes it, or finds it easy –&nbsp;when the<i><b>&nbsp;other</b></i>&nbsp;kid gets the big cake?</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p><i>Or the big gifts.</i>&nbsp;Or all the flashing cameras on her grinning mug smiling pretty over candles?</p>


<p>I saw it once at a parade: women jockeying for a better position.</p>


<p>Turns out it doesn’t matter a hill of beans how old you are, how wise you are, or how you’re sitting pretty –&nbsp;<b>the more you let yourself compete and compare, the more you forget your own calling.</b></p>


<p>I’d seen it, the women with their big handbags and big hopes:&nbsp;<b>The more you push to get in front of others, the more you fall behind in being the best you can be.</b></p>


<p>I confess, I don’t remember much of the parade… but I went home with that.</p>


<p>I went and listened to the kid with the kid sister who had this birthday coming up. She was brave and honest and said out loud that she knew she was going to feel her tummy tighten into knots when everyone handed her sister all the presents, when her sister got the stage and the candles and the cake.</p>


<p>So she showed me what her and her mom had written on a piece of paper for her, for her to carry in her pocket, hold in her hand.</p>


<p>Just three words, scrawled on a scrap of paper:</p>


<p><b>I get enough.</b></p>


<p><i>I get enough.</i></p>


<p>The kid’s eyes dance:</p>


<p>“So I remember:&nbsp;<i>I get enough cake, I get enough pretty gifts, I get enough people celebrating me too.”</i></p>


<p>That little girl holds that paper up: “I am not ever losing this. Because I can’t forget it – or that’ll ruin everything: I get enough.”</p>


<p>That’s right, girl – because a girl can forget. And that ruins everything.</p>


<p><i>A woman can forget that her life is enough</i>. That her road is enough. That her calling, her story, her singleness, her chastity, her marriage, her husband, her vocation, her apartment, her house, her childlessness, her kids, her body, her health, her work is enough.</p>


<p>A woman can look in the mirror and find it impossible to say:&nbsp;<i>I get enough.</i></p>


<p>One can forget how to believe: I get enough.</p>


<p>There’s enough scraps of paper in the world, that we could all tear up that myth of scarcity and write it down for ourselves, the certainty of abundance:<i>&nbsp;I get enough.</i></p>


<p>One can write it on the mirror:</p>


<p><b>I get enough… because I get enough Jesus – and&nbsp;<i>Jesus for me is enough.</i></b></p>


<p><b>I get enough… because I get enough God – and<i>&nbsp;God in me is enough.</i></b></p>


<p><b>I get enough… because I get enough grace – and&nbsp;<i>His grace to me is enough.</i></b></p>


<p><b>I get enough… because I get enough Love – and&nbsp;<i>His Love all around me, for me, in me, is enough.</i></b></p>


<p><i>I get enough.</i></p>


<p><b>When I can’t remember that I<i>&nbsp;get</i>&nbsp;enough – I just have to remember to&nbsp;<i>give thanks</i>.</b></p>


<p><b>Eucharisteo always precedes the miracle:</b></p>


<p><b>Give thanks&nbsp;– and you get the miracle of&nbsp;knowing that you do get enough. You get enough God.</b></p>


<p><b>The disease of not-enough… is&nbsp;</b><i><b>cured</b></i><b>&nbsp;when you&nbsp;</b><i><b>give thanks for more than enough grace.</b></i></p>


<p>Sometimes you need shorthand to help you remember what matters in the long run.</p>


<p>Shorthand for ‘I get enough’ is:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310321913/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0310321913&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=holyexper-20&amp;linkId=B4DWEYDEE7LEEKBR" target="_blank">1000 gifts.</a></p>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310321913/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0310321913&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=holyexper-20&amp;linkId=B4DWEYDEE7LEEKBR" target="_blank">It’s been given, 1000 gifts, endless gifts, more than enough gifts:</a></p>


<p>“He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all – how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?</p>


<p><b>If God didn’t hesitate to put everything on the line for us, embracing our condition and exposing Himself to the worst by sending His own Son &nbsp;–&nbsp;</b><i><b>&nbsp;is there anything else He wouldn’t gladly and freely do for us</b></i><b>?</b>” (Romans 8:32, NIV, MSG)</p>


<p><b>If God already gave us the extraordinary extravagance of Jesus –&nbsp;</b><i><b>He will give the ordinary enough of right now.</b></i></p>


<p><b>It’s always our relentless desire for more –</b><i><b>&nbsp;that destroys more and more of us.</b></i></p>


<p><b>The more you want –-</b><i><b>&nbsp;the more you will be destroyed.</b></i></p>


<p>But when we know we get enough –&nbsp;<i>we get happy for what others get.</i></p>


<p>That, always that in the pocket:&nbsp;<i>I get enough… because I get enough Jesus – and for me, Jesus is enough.</i></p>


<p>Some part of the art of life is the art of believing – that the grace in the pocket is sufficient for today, that the celebration and the feast is wide enough to encircle all of you too, that the candles light you too.</p>


<p>When the kid sister laughed over those birthday candles, you could see a pinpoint of light in everyone’s eyes, like the light of<i>&nbsp;more than enough</i>&nbsp;stars that you could see even right now, right now in broad daylight.</p>


<p>If we’d just pause to look up.</p>

<p class="speakable"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miss-usa-2019-cheslie-kryst-history-kim-kardashian-law" target="_blank">Cheslie Kryst</a> and Kaliegh Garris couldn’t be prouder to be Americans.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>

<p class="speakable">When Kryst, a North Carolina lawyer, won the Miss USA crown, it marked more than just a personal triumph in the 28-year-old’s career. It meant that for the first time, three black women are the reigning Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>

<p>Garris, 18, won Miss Teen USA, as well as Nia Franklin, 25, who was crowned as the 2019 Miss America in September.</p>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>Kryst and Garris told Fox News they hope to inspire others to proudly embrace the country they call home.</p>


<p>“Seeing people unite to win justice for others makes me proud to be an American,” said Kryst. “My stepdad, an attorney, recently worked to get a pro bono client released from prison after being behind bars for 18 years, with some help from Brittany Barnett of the Buried Alive Project. My stepdad is a busy father who coaches my brother’s football team and has an incredibly heavy workload at his firm.”</p>


<p>“Despite the hectic life he lives, he made time to fight for others who needed his expertise, time, and energy,” she continued. “His and Brittany’s work and their decision to fight for others make me beam with pride that Americans are willing to help our brothers and sisters who are in need.”</p>

<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<p>“I am proud to be an American because I live a country where I have freedoms!” shared Garris. “I have the freedom to love who I love, I have the ability to express myself through movement and have the right to speak my opinion.”</p>


<p>Garris, from New Haven, Conn., won her crown in April and hopes to become a trauma nurse. Kryst, a former Division I athlete and attorney at Poyner Spruill LLP in Charlotte, N.C., won her crown in Reno, Nev. She holds an MBA from Wake Forest University.</p>


<p>“Mine is the first generation to have that forward-looking mindset that has inclusivity, diversity, strength and empowered women,” said Kryst earlier this year after accepting her crown. “I’m looking forward to continued progress in my generation.”</p>


<p>Kryst previously told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miss-usa-2019-cheslie-kryst-history-kim-kardashian-law" target="_blank">Fox News</a> that as Miss USA, she’s eager to raise awareness on Dress for Success, a nonprofit organization that helps women by providing clothing for interviews, as well as supporting their economic advancement. She also remains just as passionate about the criminal justice system.</p>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>

<p>Before winning, Kryst served as a civil litigation attorney who also volunteered her services for people who were unjustly sentenced. She originally began her career in September 2017.</p>


<p>These days, Kryst is not only eager to be the new face of Miss USA, but also show Americans holding the title means much than wearing a crown or sash.</p>


<p>“I’m an attorney,” she said. “I have three degrees. I have a law degree, MBA and undergrad degree. And throughout the entire pageant, rather than focusing on what I looked like, what my body looked like, and whether or not I was cool to look at, the Miss Universe organization celebrated all of my accomplishments…. We all got a chance to… talk about issues that were important to us. And so, I don’t think that the Miss Universe organization is the same organization that people think it is. It really is about celebrating women, and giving us an opportunity to advocate for issues important to us.”</p>

<p class="speakable">“Donald Trump hates breastfeeding! How can he possibly get any worse?”</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">If you’re a young mother on social media, you’re likely to have seen this sentiment earlier this month when reports circulated about the administration’s decision to oppose an Ecuadorian resolution at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, a meeting of the World Health Organization.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>But as usual, especially when the Trump administration is concerned, there was more to the story. And, as usual, especially when the Trump administration is concerned, the “more” wasn’t reported by the mainstream media.</p>


<p>In its reporting on the meeting, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/health/world-health-breastfeeding-ecuador-trump.html" target="_blank">cited</a> the reasoning behind the Trump administration’s opposition as follows: “Then the United States delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations.”</p>


<p>In their caption to a photo of a baby drinking formula the Times explained “A Brooklyn mother unable to nurse fed her child donated breast milk. The $70 billion infant formula industry has seen sales flatten in wealthy countries in recent years.”</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>At no point in their reporting was proof, in the form of on- or off-the-record statements, provided that the Trump administration had taken into account the position of formula companies, or evidence that formula companies had lobbied the Trump administration due to lagging American sales.</p>


<p>What actually happened? The Times rightly reported on the what, but not why: “American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to ‘protect, promote and support breastfeeding’ and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.”</p>


<blockquote class="pull-quote"><p class="quote-text">While “breast is best” sounds great in theory, in practice restricting access to baby formula has dangerous consequences. </p></blockquote>


<p>In an op-ed in the New York Post, officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Agency for International Development <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/20/no-team-trump-doesnt-question-the-importance-of-breastfeeding/" target="_blank">explained</a>, “In particular, the guidance recommends that countries impose stringent new regulations on the marketing of any commercially produced foods suggested for children between 6 months and 3 years old. Such restrictions, in our view, prevent parents from having access to all the factual information they might need. The guidance even advocates for the prohibition of free samples of formula — including in countries and conflict zones where supplies of formula could help save babies’ lives.”</p>


<p>While fully acknowledging that “breast is best” these officials also realize that even under the most optimal conditions, breastfeeding can be difficult. When you factor in malnutrition and stress in the developing world and in conflict areas, access to formula can mean the difference between life and death.</p>


<p>Two sources familiar with the negotiations in Geneva explained further why the United States was reticent to agree to the language surrounding breastfeeding as presented by Ecuador. In diplomatic terms, the phrase “protect” would have the connotation that breastfeeding is the policy to the exclusion of everything else. Further, these sources said that the end goal for the representative from Ecuador was to make formula by prescription only; even in areas ravaged by famine and war.</p>


<p>Sadly, the Ecuadorian minister’s pipedream of the WHO restricting formula in order to “protect” breastfeeding has already been reality in Iraq. And while “breast is best” sounds great in theory, in practice restricting access to baby formula has dangerous consequences.</p>


<p>Writing for CNN two years ago Gayle Lemmon <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/12/opinions/global-breastfeeding-policies-opinion-lemmon/index.html" target="_blank">explained</a>, ‘The malnutrition we see here is primarily due to the scarcity of infant formula," [Doctors Without Borders' Iraq country director Manuel] Lannaud wrote. ‘International organizations like UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) promote breastfeeding ... and provide infant formula, but only by prescription. We believe that distributing infant formula in a conflict situation like Iraq is the only way to avoid children having to be hospitalized for malnutrition."</p>


<p>There is a tragic history of formula companies manipulating women in the third world in order to get them hooked on formula, thereby disrupting their milk supply; but the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. While we know the science indicates that breastmilk is best, there are any number of extenuating circumstances for women in the developed and developing world that makes feeding babies formula more desirable. Mothers are responsible with raising their children, and thus, should be trusted to decide how to best feed them without requiring a prescription to do so.</p>


<p>Why did officials like this Ecuadorian health minister try to make access to formula so difficult in the first place? It turns out, it wasn’t based on the science behind breastfeeding, but instead, the Western infatuation with the “breast is best” mantra. According to those familiar with the negotiations, the Ecuadorian minister wanted to force women to breastfeed because their babies were “less likely to start a war, because they feel their mother’s love through their breast milk.”</p>


<p>Thankfully, American officials in Geneva prioritized promoting actual science behind nutrition instead of this bohemian perspective on world peace. </p>

<p class="speakable">The U.S. military remains&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apnews.com/525c7a7238c94be3ae119e678fc51e08" target="_blank">released</a>&nbsp;by North Korea on Friday will be sent to a military lab in Hawaii, where they’ll enter a system that routinely identifies service members from decades-old conflicts.</p>

<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">Identifications depend on combining multiple lines of evidence, and they can take time: Even after decades, some cases remain unresolved.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>Dog tags found with the remains can help, and even scraps of clothing can be traced to the material used in uniforms. Teeth can be matched with dental records. Bones can be used to estimate height. And the distinctive shape of a clavicle bone can be matched to records of X-rays taken decades ago to look for tuberculosis, said Charles Prichard, a spokesman for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.</p>


<p>If a DNA analysis is called for, samples are sent to a military DNA lab at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.</p>


<p>Tiny samples of bone or teeth, no bigger than the amount of bone in the last joint of the pinkie finger, are enough to yield usable DNA, said Timothy McMahon, who oversees the Dover lab as director of Defense Department DNA Operations.</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>Each sample is sanded to remove surface contamination, ground to the consistency of baby powder, and then treated with a substance that dissolves the bone and leaves the DNA for analysis. That DNA is then compared with genetic samples from living people who are related to the missing.</p>


<p>The military has been collecting DNA from such family members since 1992, and has reached the relatives of 92 percent of the 8,100 service members who were listed as missing at the end of the Korean War, McMahon said.</p>

<p>The goal is to find bits of DNA in common between the known relatives and the unidentified remains, suggesting both belong to a particular lineage. One analysis develops a profile that combines what’s found at 23 spots in the DNA, for example.</p>


<p>By analyzing different kinds of DNA, lab scientists can look for markers passed down by generations of women, or of men, or of both sexes. The lab once linked remains to a great-great-great-great-grandniece who initially had no idea she was related to the missing service member, McMahon said.</p>


<p>Once a link is made, the lab estimates how strongly it suggests the remains belong to a particular person, and send the results back to Hawaii. There, it’s combined with the other lines of evidence.</p>


<p>“We’re just one spoke in a wheel to make the identification,” McMahon said. “We all work together.”</p>

<p>Since Oct. 1, the Hawaii lab has identified 25 service members from the Korean War, part of the 119 identifications made overall in that time period, Prichard said. For the 12 months before that, 42 sets of remains from the Korean War were accounted for, which includes briefing the relatives in person, out of 183 overall.</p>


<p>The agency identifies remains from not only the Korean War, but also World War II through the first Gulf War in Iraq.</p>

<p>How long does it take?</p>


<p>If a clavicle bone can be matched to an X-ray, it might be done in just three days, Prichard said. But in other cases, it can take decades. He noted some remains recovered from North Korea from 1990 to 2005 are still awaiting identification.</p>


<p>For Jan Curran, of Gilbert, Arizona, the new remains turned over by North Korea have stirred hope.</p>


<p>Curran has no memory of her father, naval aviator Lt. Charles Garrison, who was shot down over Korea and captured in May 1951. He died in captivity, and no remains have been identified.</p>


<p>Curran, 70, has spent decades working to give him a proper burial. She’s attended scores of meetings for families of those missing in action in Korea. She was the driving force in the late 1990s in getting several of her family members — including her sister, an aunt, an uncle and cousins — to join her in giving DNA samples to the military in an effort to identify her father’s remains, should they be found.</p>


<p>Will their long wait now come to an end?</p>


<p>“We know it’s a small chance, but we can’t help but hope,” she said, her voice breaking with emotion. “It would be wonderful. It’s too much to hope for.</p>


<p>“It’s amazing, after all these years, how much it can still hurt not to have him.”</p>

<p class="speakable">The 33-year-old former Bachelorette opened up to ET's Katie Krause about marriage, parenting and body image at Hallmark's Summer TCA last week. Fedotowsky and her husband, Kevin Manno,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etonline.com/ali-fedotowsky-welcomes-second-child-with-husband-kevin-manno-102826" target="_blank">welcomed baby</a>&nbsp;boy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etonline.com/ali-fedotowsky-reveals-name-of-baby-boy-see-the-precious-first-photo-103055" target="_blank">Riley</a>&nbsp;back in May. The couple also shares a 2-year-old daughter, Molly.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>"My husband and I&nbsp;have not slept in the same bed in two months," Fedotowsky, who is&nbsp;part of Hallmark's 'Home &amp; Family,'" revealed. </p>


<p>"He does a morning radio show really early and I&nbsp;need him to get a good sleep. Even on weekends, when he's not doing the show, I need him to get a good sleep, so he can wake up with Molly, so I&nbsp;can get a few extra hours of sleep."</p>

<p>When Manno gets home from work around noon, he takes over parenting duties, which allows the reality star to focus on her blog and other business endeavors.</p>


<p>"It's a lot. Our relationship suffers. I'd love to say, 'Oh yeah, me and my husband are passionately making out on the side with our two kids,'&nbsp;but I'm not even sure I've made out with my husband in a really long time," Fedotowsky said.</p>


<p>"We love each other so much. We know that this is a time where the kids are coming first and we are going to&nbsp;have to eventually put our relationship first. And we will, but we're in the thick of it [now].&nbsp;We have a 2-year-old and a 2-month-old. We are just all kids right now. Eventually we're going to make out passionately and have an amazing time, but it's just hard right now."</p>


<p>Though they have the&nbsp;sleeping arrangement somewhat&nbsp;worked out, it doesn't mean the parents are actually getting a lot of shut eye.</p>

<p>"When Riley sleeps... my 2-year-old Molly&nbsp;wants my attention. It is so hard, but it is awesome," Fedotowsky said. </p>


<p>"It's a weird balance because&nbsp;I don't want to&nbsp;be like, 'OMG,&nbsp;being a mom is so hard, blah blah blah,' but I&nbsp;also don't want to&nbsp;be like, 'Being a mom is great! Motherhood is pure bliss!'&nbsp;It's a juggling act for sure and I wish someone told me how much harder two&nbsp;was because maybe I would have waited a little longer."</p>


<p>Fedotowsky has also been open about her post-pregnancy body. In an Instagram post earlier this month, she shared pics that showcased her scars, loose skin and lingering tummy in order to help women accept their bodies.</p>


<p>"One day I&nbsp;was taking pictures in this swimwear line and I&nbsp;was&nbsp;looking at the photos after... and I&nbsp;was&nbsp;like, 'That's not what I&nbsp;look like... that's not what I want to&nbsp;show because that's not what I look like.' When I look in the mirror that's not what I&nbsp;see," she said.</p>


<p>"And so... I&nbsp;was like, all right, this is my stomach... I&nbsp;thought it was important to show, but... I had no idea how&nbsp;many women needed to see that. I&nbsp;was blown away by the response of woman...&nbsp;I wasn't expecting the response. It's just so cool to see how many women that post inspired to love themselves more and accept themselves more."</p>

<p>Though she was initially hesitant to share the post, her husband helped to give her the courage to go through with it.</p>


<p>"I never would have been able to post that if my husband, Kevin, wasn't so amazing. Because at the end of the day, the only person I care about who looks at my body is him.&nbsp;He's who I want to look at my body and love my body, besides myself," Fedotowsky&nbsp;said.</p>


<p>"He loves me&nbsp;and was so all about it, and thought it was awesome I was doing it, and made me feel confident. I&nbsp;never would have been able to do that if it wasn't for him."</p>

<p class="speakable">Meghan Markle's first birthday as a royal is on the horizon.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">On August 4, the Duchess of Sussex will celebrate her 37th birthday. But in royal fashion, Meghan will spend her big day doing royal duties.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>According to royal photographer Tim Rooke, the new duchess will spend her birthday with Prince Harry at his friend's wedding. Rooke tweeted that not only will Harry attend the wedding of his close friend, Charlie Van Straubenze on August 4, but he will also serve as the best man in the ceremony.</p>


<p>"Unfortunately I will be missing the wedding of Charlie Van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks where Prince Harry will be best man on August 4th in Churt Surrey as I will be on the beach," the photographer tweeted on July 27. "Can't do everything!"</p>

<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>And though it seems like Harry may be busy on his wife's big day, there is sure to be some kind of birthday celebration from the royal family as Meghan's birthday coincidentally falls on the same day as the Queen Mother's birthday.</p>


<p>Queen Elizabeth's late mother, Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon, was an intricate part of the royal family and played a key role in grooming Queen Elizabeth to take over the crown after her father, George VI, died in 1952.</p>


<div class="embed-media fn-video" originalimageurl="http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/14/694940094001_5797551088001_5797542106001-vs.jpg"><div class="video-container"><div data-widget-type="embed" data-video-id="5797542106001" data-video-domain="foxnews" class="m video-player"><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5797542106001"><img src="http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/14/694940094001_5797551088001_5797542106001-vs.jpg" alt="Meghan Markle shares first solo engagement with the Queen"><span class="overlay">Video</span></a></div></div></div>


<p>The Queen Mother died in March 2002 at the age of 101, less than two months after her youngest daughter, Princess Margaret, died that February. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/30/queenmother.monarchy12" target="_blank">According to the Guardian</a>, the Queen Mother, who was very close to her grandchildren, left close to $24 million in trusts for them.</p>


<p>And while Meghan may be growing closer to her new British family, she seems to be drifting away from her own as her father, Thomas Markle, continues to speak out against her to the press.</p>


<p>On Sunday, the Markle family drama continued when Thomas claimed that he had been "cut off" from his daughter but still wants to send her a card for her birthday.</p>

<p>"If I send a birthday card to Kensington Palace, or wherever she's living now, it'll just be one among thousands," he told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/how-meghan-markle-will-spend-her-37th-birthday-with-prince-harry-106958" target="_blank">The Mail on Sunday.</a> "I thought about sending it by Priority Mail Express, but the Palace would probably just soak it in water for three days to make sure it doesn't explode."</p>


<p>Meghan is almost four years older than Harry, who will celebrate is 34th birthday on September 15.</p>

Black discusses serious threats on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.'</p></div></div></div></div>


<p class="speakable">Last week, a man was indicted for threatening to kill Republican Rep. Diane Black. “They were serious enough threats that the grand jury did take action,” Black said in an interview with Fox News.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>

<p class="speakable">It’s been barely a year since the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise during congressional baseball practice, and the story of the threats to Rep. Diane Black were barely a blip in our news.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>The shooting last June should have been a wake-up call for our political discourse, but we’ve only been on a further slide since then.</p>


<p>This month, Black’s fellow GOP congressman, Jason Lewis, says his daughters were threatened. A man threatened to chop up Sen. Rand Paul’s family with an ax.</p>


<blockquote class="pull-quote"><p class="quote-text">The shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise during congressional baseball practice last June should have been a wake-up call for our political discourse, but we’ve only been on a further slide since then.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another was arrested outside the campaign office of Rep. Lee Zeldin for threatening to kill Trump supporters. And the Nebraska GOP office had bricks thrown through its windows and graffiti painted on its wall.</p>


<p>Last week, a guy was beaten up in Oakland after a crowd thought he was a member of the Proud Boys, a right-wing pro-Trump men’s-rights group.</p>


<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/24/the-perils-of-nazi-punching/" target="_blank">In September I wrote about the perils of Nazi-punching</a>, and how the online glee about a white supremacist being punched was misplaced and dangerous. One of my concerns was that the violence being cheered wouldn’t end with Nazis. It didn’t.</p>


<p>A telling incident took place this month when a group of Proud Boys wearing MAGA hats got into a fight at an LA bar.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-proud-boys-bar-20180717-story.html" target="_blank">This LA Times quote from Josh Androsky</a>, who led the fight against the Boys, is a stunner: “The Proud Boys say they’re not Nazis, and duh, they’re not from 1945, they’re not 100 years old. But in America, there’s a fun little thing, which is a catch-all term for right-wing racist hate groups, and it’s Nazi.”</p>


<p>He added: “The First Amendment protects the right to peaceably assemble. There’s no such thing as a peaceable assembly of Nazis. Just by virtue of their ideology, they are causing harm.”</p>


<p>Absurd. Even actual 100-year-old Nazis are protected by the First Amendment. Where are the prominent liberals to tell their supporters that, no, they can’t actually punch anyone they disagree with?</p>


<p>Before the election, there was a lot of concern that Donald Trump would lose and his supporters would take to the streets.&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/807615/donald-trumps-conspiracy-theories-are-making-his-supporters-paranoid-and-dangerous" target="_blank">Quartz magazine quoted Trump supporters</a>&nbsp;who threatened “revolution” if he lost.&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/807615/donald-trumps-conspiracy-theories-are-making-his-supporters-paranoid-and-dangerous/" target="_blank">An LA Times op-ed by Doyle McManus</a>&nbsp;found Trump fans saying there’d be a “civil war.”</p>


<p>Since the election, there have been similar pieces about what Trump supporters would do if he were to get impeached or if he lost in 2020.</p>


<p>But there’s been very little exploration into the continuing violent outbursts by people unhappy that Donald Trump is president. The inevitable march from confronting Cabinet members in restaurants to confronting ordinary supporters of the president continues apace.</p>


<p>Where is the Democratic leadership? What would their response be if the party ID were reversed? And why isn’t the media hounding them for answers?</p>


<p>Even during the election, Republican leadership spoke out against Trump encouraging violence at his rallies. In March 2016 both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio issued statements. Cruz was still in the race, so his shot could be seen as a political move on a competitor, but Rubio was out and pledging to support any eventual GOP nominee. Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Mitch McConnell both also made comments about the violence with McConnell noting that he had spoken to Trump about it.</p>


<p>It’s Dems’ turn.</p>


<p>In June, Maxine Waters famously said “If you see anybody from [the Trump] Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station — you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. Tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere!” Her comments were greeted with appropriate outrage.</p>


<p>People — yes, even those who work in the Trump White House — should be allowed to pump gas or shop without having a crowd “push back on them.”</p>

<p class="speakable">Gun control advocates don’t just have a problem with the Second Amendment – they also have real problems with the First Amendment. In an era when people can use 3D metal printers to make guns, does the First Amendment protect a book detailing a gun-manufacturing process – but not a computer file that does the same thing?</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">The question has become particularly urgent. The computer programs that tell 3D printers how to produce these guns were scheduled to be legally downloadable Wednesday. However, on Tuesday U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order blocking the downloads until a hearing Aug. 10.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>Lasnik's order came in response to a lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general in <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/3d-printed-guns-21-states-ask-trump-admin-for-an-emergency-ban/" target="_blank">eight states</a>&nbsp;seeking an emergency injunction to stop the legal downloads. They <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/3d-printed-guns-21-states-ask-trump-admin-for-an-emergency-ban/" target="_blank">argue</a>d the downloads would create a “great detriment of the public and public safety.”</p>


<p>Even President Trump weighed in <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1024264286418489345" target="_blank">with a tweet</a> Tuesday saying: “I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!”</p>


<p>The courts have previously weighed in on a similar First Amendment question. In 2010, the Supreme Court found that the First Amendment protects <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1448.ZS.html" target="_blank">violent video games</a> in the same way that newspapers and books are protected.</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>A 2001 decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5930508913825375010&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">said</a>: “Communication does not lose constitutional protection as ‘speech’ simply because it is expressed in the language of computer code.”</p>


<p>If you believe gun control advocates, 3D printers will undermine all our gun control laws, letting criminals avoid background checks and making it impossible to ban types of guns. But gun control advocates don’t understand the technology has already outpaced the ability of government to regulate it.</p>


<p>If they want, criminals can already print guns. The change that had been scheduled to take place Wednesday would have had no noticeable impact on criminals avoiding background checks and obtaining guns illegally, because the existing laws aren’t stopping them.</p>


<p>With a 3D metal printer, people can use these computer files to make metal guns <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ZYKMBDm4M" target="_blank">functionally and visually indistinguishable</a> from a store-bought gun. Metal printers with the capacity to build a firearm are running at less than $10,000, and the price continues to drop.</p>


<p>The printers allow people to make so-called “ghost guns,” which don’t have registered serial numbers and aren’t made by regulated gun makers. Disaster is said to be imminent.</p>


<p>A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/3-d-printed-guns-put-carnage-a-click-away/2018/07/28/3b254a18-91cb-11e8-b769-e3fff17f0689_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5153fc956000" target="_blank">Washington Post editorial</a> this past Sunday had no problem with exceptions to the First Amendment and warned that posting these computer programs will eviscerate gun control laws and “lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives.”</p>


<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-schumer-ghost-guns-20180722-story.html" target="_blank">Sen. Chuck Schumer</a>, D-N.Y., cautioned the 3D-printed guns would lead to a “gut-wrenching epidemic of gun violence.” Twenty-one state attorneys general – all but one a Democrat – wrote the Trump administration claiming printed guns would create “an unprecedented impact on public safety.”</p>


<p>In May 2013, then 25-year-old Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson uploaded a computer file with instructions for 3D printers to make a predominantly plastic gun. Within just two days, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2322150/Blueprints-3D-plastic-gun-downloaded-100-000-times-2-days-State-Department-orders-site-weapon-designs.html" target="_blank">100,000 copies</a>&nbsp;of the blueprint were downloaded around the world. Within a week, the file was available on over 4,000 computers around the world.</p>


<p>Legal computer programs or not, it doesn’t matter: as we've seen with movies, file sharing is unstoppable. The most pirated TV program in 2017 was Season 7 of “Game of Thrones,” with well over <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/most-pirated-television-shows-2017-game-of-thrones-1201911688/" target="_blank">10 million illegal downloads</a> in most weeks.</p>


<p>You also don’t even need these computer files to print a gun. One can take apart a gun and take pictures of each part, then use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WTns1ItVss" target="_blank">photogrammetry program</a> that links together the different images to create 3D images.</p>


<p>Proposals to treat printers like guns and require <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/3d-printer-regulation-proposed-democrats-fear-criminals-printing-guns-1254537" target="_blank">background checks, mandatory serial numbers, and even a registration process</a> before they can be purchased are easily circumvented.</p>


<p>Even if the government registered printers, gangs could steal them or try to buy them illegally.&nbsp;You can even <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2013/november/scientists-build-low-cost-open-source-3d-metal-printer.html" target="_blank">make your own</a> printer from designs that have been available for years on the Internet.</p>


<p>When 3D printers are used to make guns, gun control advocates are out of a job. Anyone will be able to go into the illegal gun-making business.</p>


<p>Of course, people with a machine shop can already make guns. But 3D printers no longer require even the most basic skills. Just download blueprints or scan images of the parts that you want copied, load the metal printing cartridge, and press “print.”</p>


<p>Forget about banning high-capacity bullet magazines. Many parts of a gun can be made with very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even simple machine tools.</p>


<p>It’s a dirty little secret of the gun control debate that background checks are already pretty useless in keeping guns out of criminal hands. The war on guns has failed as badly as the war on drugs. Incidentally, the same drug dealers supply both items.</p>


<p>Every place that has banned either all guns or all handguns has seen an <a href="https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/" target="_blank">increase</a> in murders. This is for the simple reason that primarily law-abiding people obey the bans. Enacting a law and enforcing it are two entirely separate things.</p>


<p>Possibly the coming months will finally make it obvious to everyone that gun control doesn’t work. Despite gun control advocates making apocalyptic claims of imminent disaster, if legal downloads of blueprints for guns are eventually legal it won't make a noticeable difference.</p>


<p>The same people decrying 3D-printed guns predicted skyrocketing crime rates after the federal assault weapon ban sunset in 2004 or when state after state has passed concealed handgun laws. Gun control advocates make extreme predictions and then hope no one will remember what they promised. This latest scare will be no different.</p>

<p class="speakable">The US Air Force is now accelerating a massive AI push to cyber-harden networks, improve weapons systems and transform functions of large combat air platforms such as the B-2, F-15 and F-35, service officials said.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">“The Air Force has over 600 projects incorporating a facet of artificial intelligence to address various mission sets,” Capt. Hope Cronin, Air Force spokeswoman, told Warrior Maven.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>While AI can of course massively expedite data consolidation, cloud migration and various kinds much-needed cybersecurity functions, it is increasingly being applied more broadly across weapons systems and large platforms.</p>


<p>AI performs a wide range of functions not purely restricted to conventional notions of IT or cyberspace; computer algorithms are increasingly able to almost instantaneously access vast pools of data, compare and organize information and perform automated procedural and analytical functions for human decision-makers in a role of command and control.</p>


<p>When high-volume, redundant tasks are performed through computer automation, humans are freed up to expend energy pursuing a wider range of interpretive or conceptual work.</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>For the F-35, B-2 and F-15, Rapid data-base access, organizing information and performing high-volume procedural functions are all decided advantages of AI applications. Algorithms, for example, are increasingly able to scan, view and organize targeting, ISR and sensor input such as navigation information, radar warning information, images or video.</p>


<p>The F-35, for instance, uses early iterations of artificial intelligence to help acquire, organize and present information to the pilot on a single screen without much human intervention. Often referred to as easing the cognitive burden upon pilots, the effort is geared toward systematically presenting information from a range of disparate sensors on a single screen. The F-35s widely-discussed sensor fusion, for example, is evidence of this phenomenon, as it involves consolidating targeting, navigation and sensor information for pilots.</p>


<p>An F-35 computer system, Autonomic Logistics Information System, involves early applications of artificial intelligence wherein computers make assessments, go through checklists, organize information and make some decisions by themselves - without needing human intervention.</p>


<p>The computer, called ALIS, makes the aircraft's logistics tail more automated and is able to radio back information about engine health or other avionics.</p>


<p>A single, secure information environment provides users with up-to-date information on any of these areas using web-enabled applications on a distributed network, a statement from ALIS- builder Lockheed Martin says</p>


<p>ALIS serves as the information infrastructure for the F-35, transmitting aircraft health and maintenance action information to the appropriate users on a globally-distributed network to technicians worldwide, the statement continues.</p>


<p>​As a result, F-35 pilots will be able to control a small group of drones flying nearby from the aircraft cockpit in the air, performing sensing, reconnaissance and targeting functions.</p>


<p>At the moment, the flight path, sensor payload and weapons disposal of airborne drones such as Air Force Predators and Reapers are coordinated from ground control stations.</p>


<p>For instance, real-time video feeds from the electro-optical/infrared sensors on board an Air Force Predator, Reaper or Global Hawk drone could go directly into an F-35 cockpit, without needing to go to a ground control station. This could speed up targeting and tactical input from drones on reconnaissance missions in the vicinity of where a fighter pilot might want to attack. In fast-moving combat circumstances involving both air-to-air and air-to-ground threats, increased speed could make a large difference.</p>


<p>The prospect of using advanced algorithms and on-board computers to quickly perform a range of aircraft functions, while enabling human decision makers in a role of command and control, is further explored in a research paper from a London-based think tank called “Chatham House- Royal Institute of International Affairs.”</p>


<p>The 2017 essay, titled “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Warfare,” explains how fighter and bomber pilot “checklists” can be enabled by AI as “cognitive-aiding tools.”</p>


<p>“…pilots rely significantly on procedures to help them manage the complexity of various tasks. For instance, when a fire-light illuminates or another subsystem indicates a problem, pilots are trained to first stabilize the aircraft (a skill) but then turn to the manual to determine the correct procedure (rule following). Such codified procedures are necessary since there are far too many solutions to possible problems to be remembered,” the Chatham House paper writes.</p>


<p>The Air Force’s stealthy B-2 bomber is yet another example; the aircraft is receiving a new flight management control processor which increases the performance of the avionics and on-board computer systems by about 1,000-times, Air Force officials said.</p>


<p>The upgrade is a quantum improvement over the legacy system, providing over a thousand times the processor throughput, memory, and network speed, according to senior Air Force leaders. The new processor will help automated navigation programs and expedite the B-2s “fly-by-wire” technology – all of which are designed to enable a pilot to expend energy upon the most pressing combat tasks with less intervention.</p>


<p>The B-2 Flight Management Control Processor Upgrade, also known as the Extremely High Frequency, Increment 1 processor upgrade, completed the final aircraft install in August 2016, Air Force officials told Warrior Maven last year.</p>


<p>Faster, more capable processors will enable the aircraft’s avionics, radar, sensors and communications technologies to better identify and attack enemy targets. The sensor-to-shooter time will be greatly reduced, allowing the B-2 to launch weapons much more effectively, therefore reducing its exposure to enemy attacks.</p>


<p>Although built in the 1980s, the B-2 is a digital airplane which uses what’s called a “glass cockpit” for flight controls and on-board systems.</p>


<p>The upgrade involves the re-hosting of the flight management control processors, the brains of the airplane, onto much more capable integrated processing units. This results in the laying-in of some new fiber optic cable as opposed to the mix bus cable being used right now – because the B-2’s computers from the 80s are getting maxed out and overloaded with data, Air Force officials told Warrior.</p>


<p>Improved Processing capacity for the B-2 will enable the upcoming integration of digital nuclear weapons, such as the B61-12, service officials explained.</p>


<p>Also, the Air Force F-15 is now being engineered with the fastest jet-computer processor in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII.</p>


<p>“It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew,” Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Warrior last year.</p>

<p>Farmer Wayne Cheney speaks to Fox News&nbsp;— one day after the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/04/fbi-speaks-to-pig-farmer-for-second-time-about-missing-mollie-tibbetts.html" target="_blank">FBI went back to his farm</a> to question him in connection with Tibbetts' disappearance.</p>


<p>During the interview, Cheney says he would let the FBI search his entire property; he expressed confidence the bureau wouldn't find anything. So far, the FBI has searched his home and parts of his property, and looked through his cellphone.</p>


<p>He also claims he's never seen Tibbetts before, because he doesn't venture into Brooklyn, where she lives.</p>


<p>As for what the FBI has asked him about, his response was "I don't know."</p>


<p>Cheney says law enforcement asked him to take a polygraph test and he refused. He has not been charged with a crime and says he “has nothing to hide.”</p>


<h3>Aug. 3&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Kevin Winker, director of investigative operations with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, speaks about the case at a news conference.</p>


<p>"Although we appreciated everyone that showed up today to this press conference, our position has not changed on the release of case facts, results and conclusions," <a href="http://abc7news.com/missing-college-student-mollie-tibbetts-a-timeline/3816516/" target="_blank">Winker says</a>. "I understand this is frustrating for many in the public and the media, but feel this is necessary for our investigation."</p>


<p>Winker is also asked about suspects while at the briefing.</p>


<p>"As far as suspects go, we continue to look at all possibilities," he says. "I'm not in a position right now to say, we have suspects, we don't have suspects, persons of interest or anything else."</p>


<p>Later, Winker says authorities are handling the case as "a missing persons investigation."</p>


<p>That same day, the FBI returned to a farm <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/04/fbi-speaks-to-pig-farmer-for-second-time-about-missing-mollie-tibbetts.html" target="_blank">to again question Wayne Cheney in connection with Tibbetts' disappearance</a>.</p>


<p>An FBI agent was seen by Fox News arriving and speaking to Cheney for about five to 10 minutes Friday afternoon.</p>


<h3>Aug. 2</h3>


<p>Search teams scan ditches for traces of Tibbetts near a farm investigators searched a week prior after a possible new clue to her disappearance — a red shirt spotted by a person mowing the lawn — was apparently found.</p>


<h3>Aug. 1</h3>


<p>Tibbetts' father, Rob, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/01/mollie-tibbetts-dad-urges-any-witness-to-come-forward-says-somebody-knows-something.html" target="_blank">urges the public</a> to come forward with any information regarding his missing daughter in an interview with Fox News Channel.</p>


<p>“The bottom line is somebody knows something," Rob says, adding Brooklyn is a small city and “you can’t do anything there without someone seeing it.”</p>


<p>Rob also reveals Tibbetts' phone has not yet been located, and she has not been responsive to messages.</p>


<p>Local farmer Wayne Cheney confirms to Fox News FBI investigators searched his property and home a week prior. Authorities held his cell phone overnight, checking it for any clues or communications regarding Tibbetts.</p>


<p>"I don't know who those two [officials] were but they took me down to the fire station Tuesday and questioned me for two hours,” the farmer told WHO-DT. "I don’t remember what they asked me."</p>


<p>WHO-DT, citing Iowa court documents, reports the farmer previously entered guilty pleas for two instances of stalking – one in Poweshiek County in 2009 and another in Marion County in 2014.</p>


<h3>July 31</h3>


<p>Police in Pella say a man being sought for taking pictures of female joggers on July 27 has turned himself in.</p>


<p>Investigator Kevin Winker says during an afternoon news conference that officials are continuing to follow every tip that comes in about Tibbetts.</p>


<p>Investigators are still unsure about what exactly happened to Tibbetts, Winker says, though they can confirm&nbsp;her disappearing on her own is "not consistent with her past."</p>


<h3>July 28</h3>

<h3>July 27</h3>


<p>Pella Police receive a call about a suspicious man taking photos of female joggers from a parked car.</p>


<p>“As covertly as he possibly could, took photos of them unbeknownst to them, it seemed to be very creepy,”&nbsp;Pella Police Chief Robert Bokinsky tells&nbsp;<a href="https://whotv.com/2018/07/28/pella-police-searching-for-suspicious-man-in-parked-car-seen-taking-pictures-of-young-joggers/" target="_blank">WHOTV</a>.</p>


<div class="embed-media twitter"><div class="tweet-embed"></div></div>


<p>However, authorities didn't say whether there was a link between the suspicious man and Tibbetts’ disappearance.</p>


<p>"[There's] nothing illegal about taking a picture of somebody, if that’s what he did," Pella, Lt. Shane Cox explains to Fox News.</p>

          The condition, known medically as necrotizing fasciitis, is rare, with about 4 cases per 100,000 people occurring each year in the United States.
          <span>(Felix MAckel)</span></p></div></div></div>


<p class="speakable">Flesh-eating bacteria" is as scary as it sounds — a serious infection that spreads quickly in the body and can result in the loss of limbs and even death.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">But the condition, known medically as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/20251-flesh-eating-bacteria.html" target="_blank">necrotizing fasciitis</a>, is also rare, with about 4 cases per 100,000 people occurring each year in the United States, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034115001288#bib0130" target="_blank">2015 study</a>.</p>


<p>Still, given the gravity of the condition — which destroys skin and muscle tissue — people with it need immediate medical care. But how do you know if your cut has flesh-eating bacteria?</p>


<p>First, to clarify, there are several types of bacteria that can cause necrotizing fasciitis, including group A&nbsp;<i>Streptococcus</i>&nbsp;(group A strep),&nbsp;<i>Klebsiella</i>,&nbsp;<i>Clostridium</i>,&nbsp;<i>Escherichia coli</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Most commonly, people get necrotizing fasciitis when the bacteria enter the body through breaks in the skin, including cuts and scrapes, burns and surgical wounds, the CDC says.</p>


<p>One feature of necrotizing fasciitis is "pain that's out of proportion" to the wound, said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. People with the condition often report "exquisite pain and sensitivity," Glatter told Live Science. Some patients may also experience crackling sounds or sensations due to the presence of air under the tissue, he added. (Some species of bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis produce gas, which results in air under the tissue.) &nbsp;[<a href="https://www.livescience.com/13694-devastating-infectious-diseases-smallpox-plague.html" target="_blank">27 Devastating Infectious Diseases</a>]</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>Other early symptoms include a red or swollen area of skin around the cut that spreads quickly, and pain beyond the area of skin that's red, according to the CDC. People who have these symptoms after injury should see their doctor right away, the CDC says. Symptoms often begin within hours of injury.</p>


<p>Patients may also experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/61489-woman-flu-flesh-eating-bacteria.html" target="_blank">flu-like symptoms</a>, including fever, stomachache, nausea, diarrhea, chills and body aches, according to the National Institutes of Health's&nbsp;<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6454/necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank">Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD)</a>.</p>


<p>Later symptoms of the condition include ulcers, blisters or black spots on the skin and pus oozing from the infected area, the CDC says. As the infection spreads, a patient may become confused or delirious; and pain may appear to improve as nerves are destroyed, according to GARD.</p>


<p>Anyone can get necrotizing fasciitis, although the majority of people who develop it have other health problems that lower their bodies' ability to fight infection, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/43477-diabetes-symptoms-types.html" target="_blank">diabetes</a>, kidney disease, cancer and liver disease, according to the CDC.</p>


<p>Another risk factor is exposing a wound to seawater that contains&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/56619-flesh-eating-bacteria-ocean-vibrio-vulnificus.html" target="_blank"><i>Vibrio vulnificus</i></a>, another cause of necrotizing fasciitis.</p>


<p>Patients with necrotizing fasciitis need quick and aggressive treatments, Glatter said. The mortality rate is estimated to be between 25 and 35 percent, and sometimes as high as 50 percent, according to the 2015 study.</p>


<p>The condition is treated with strong, intravenous antibiotics, and with surgery to remove dead tissue. Sometimes, doctors need to amputate an infected limb to stop the infection from spreading, the CDC says.</p>


<p>Proper wound care can help prevent bacterial skin infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, according to the CDC. People are advised to clean all minor cuts with soap and water; cover open wounds with clean, dry bandages until they heal; and see a doctor for puncture wounds and other deep or serious wounds.</p>

          Prince George (left) and sister Princess Charlotte must reportedly bow and curtsy to their great-grandmother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
          <span>(AP)</span></p></div></div></div>


<p class="speakable">Siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte are getting an early education on becoming British royals.</p>

<p class="speakable">Royal historian and author Marlene Eilers Koening told <a href="https://ca.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2018072750601/prince-george-princess-charlotte-bow-curtsy-queen/" target="_blank">Hello!</a> Tuesday the children must bow and curtsy to their great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, at public engagements.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>“Certainly by age five,” she explained. “The only person they will curtsy or bow to is the sovereign. A royal highness does not curtsy to another royal highness. Yes, there are articles that state this, but it is not true.”</p>


<p>George, who turned five on July 22, will be expected to begin publicly bowing to the queen shortly. The magazine noted it’s likely that the future king has done so in private when greeting Elizabeth, 92.</p>


<div class="embed-media twitter"><div class="tweet-embed"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>Charlotte, who turned three years old in May, has a few more years before she begins following her brother, who is third in line to the British throne. However, she was spotted last summer giving a mini curtsy to diplomats while on a royal tour with her parents.</p>


<p>Their youngest brother Louis is three months old.</p>


<p>“Curtsying and bowing is etiquette, nothing to do with precedence," said Koening. "You bow or curtsey the first time you see the sovereign and then again when you leave.</p>


<p>"At Christmas at church, we saw the Cambridges and Prince Harry and Meghan [Markle] curtsy and bow when the queen arrived and left. Other royals including Charles did not because they had come from Sandringham and had already seen the queen.”</p>


<p><a href="https://www.womansworld.com/posts/prince-george-princess-charlotte-curtsy-queen-elizabeth-163799" target="_blank">Women’s World</a> added the royal children, who all have “His Royal Highness” or “Her Royal Highness” before their names, do not have to genuflect in front of their parents. They also don’t have to bow for their older relatives either.</p>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<p>But the children aren’t the only ones learning proper royal etiquette.</p>


<p>Sir William Heseltine, one of the queen’s private secretaries, revealed that members of the royal family should wait until the monarch retires to bed, before they also hit the hay.</p>


<p>In an interview for the book, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/25/meghan-markle-will-need-to-follow-royal-bedtime-rule-claims-palace-insider.html" target="_blank">“The Royals in Australia,”</a> Heseltine shared that “nobody felt it right to go to bed before the queen did.”</p>


<p>While this tradition is something Markle may need to adopt now that she’s officially the Duchess of Sussex, it was something Princess Diana struggled with.</p>


<p>“For Diana the long royal evenings were agony,” he explained. “There’d be an hour or so in the sitting room of everyone sitting around making conversation, and nobody felt it right to go to bed before the queen did.</p>


<p>"And Diana was driven to such extremes that she’d excuse herself and go to bed, which was thought to be rather bad form going to bed before the queen.”</p>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/25/meghan-markle-will-need-to-follow-royal-bedtime-rule-claims-palace-insider.html" target="_blank">News.com.au</a> noted the bedtime tradition isn’t the only rule the former “Suits” star will need to learn.</p>


<p>Last month, Twitter used claimed the 36-year-old had breached royal protocol after an Irish politician suggested she was pleased with Ireland’s abortion referendum result.</p>


<p>According to the UK Parliament website: “Although not prohibited by law, it is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to vote in an election.”</p>


<p>Reports also surfaced that should Markle become pregnant, she is unlikely to be allowed to have a baby shower.</p>


<p>Royal expert Victoria Arbiter said throwing an elaborate baby shower is unheard of for members of the British monarchy.</p>


<div class="embed-media instagram"></div>


<p>“While the royals are very wealthy… a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate… there’s nothing they can’t go and but themselves,” she told <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/07/25/meghan-markle-will-need-to-follow-royal-bedtime-rule-claims-palace-insider.html" target="_blank">UK’s Daily Mail</a>.</p>

<p class="speakable">Like a baseball team that is way behind going into the fifth inning, Democrats (and socialists) are hoping for the political equivalent of a rainout, so that the game President Trump is winning will be canceled, allowing them time to regroup.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">The president’s opponents are going to need more than that figurative cancellation, however; they’re going to need a real plan of action. Democrats, whose policies of tax, spend and regulate, are being reversed, seem to have nothing to offer except failed policies that have slowed growth and discouraged business expansion. Their “policy” is a vain hope that “scandal” and Russian “collusion” will lead to Trump’s downfall. So far that strategy isn’t working. His base continues to support him.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>During the 2016 campaign when candidate Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/trump-claims-his-economic-plan-would-create-35-annual-gdp-growth.html" target="_blank">pledged</a> a growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 4 percent, “experts” claimed it was impossible. President Obama said we would have to accept much smaller growth because the days of rapid economic expansion were over.</p>


<p>The left is coming up with all sorts of excuses, including the export of large amounts of soybeans, to explain 4.1 percent GDP growth as a one-off. Some of the same “experts” who claimed such growth was impossible now say it is unsustainable. Let’s recall that other ‘experts” said there was no way Donald Trump could beat Hillary Clinton. And yet the media continue to return to these people, as they might a soothsayer, hoping they will get it right next time.</p>


<blockquote class="pull-quote"><p class="quote-text">President Obama once said it was impossible to bring back manufacturing. At a 2016 PBS town hall event, Obama derisively said: “Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There’s no answer to it." </p></blockquote>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>Within days of his inauguration, the <a href="http://time.com/money/4754213/stock-market-trump-100-days-presidents/" target="_blank">Dow Jones</a> industrial average climbed above the 20,000 mark for the first time. As of last Friday the Dow stood at <a href="http://www.thereporter.com/article/zz/20180727/NEWS/180729050" target="_blank">25,451</a>, a <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUKL4N1P045S" target="_blank">5,000-point</a> rise. Retirees with their 401k accounts and other investments must be happy with those numbers. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/576552028/fact-check-trump-touts-low-unemployment-rates-for-african-americans-hispanics" target="_blank">Low unemployment</a> figures for African Americans and Hispanics (President Trump <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/trump-takes-undue-credit-black-unemployment/" target="_blank">claims</a> they are the lowest in history “because of my policies,” even though black unemployment had been on a years-long downward trend when he assumed office) nonetheless have fueled a hiring boom.</p>


<p>Tax cuts and tax reform have put more money in the pockets of some Americans to spend (or save) on goods and services, producing more of them and leading to the hiring of more people, who will pay more taxes. The Treasury last quarter again took in record amounts of revenue, though Congress spends it faster than it comes in.</p>


<p>It appears the president may have won a significant battle in the trade war with a promise last week from European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-eu-immediately-resolve-steel-aluminum-tariffs-mnuchin-133302719.html" target="_blank">negotiate</a> zero tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum; something else the “experts” said was impossible. The president is on the way to winning this battle because of his assertion that the U.S. has been treated unfairly by other countries that slap tariffs and taxes on American goods while we import their products with few or no penalties.</p>


<p>President Obama once said it was impossible to bring back manufacturing. At a 2016 PBS town hall event, Obama derisively <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/281936-obama-to-trump-what-magic-wand-do-you-have" target="_blank">said</a>: “Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What exactly are you going to do? There’s no answer to it,” adding, “He just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’ Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn’t have an answer.”</p>


<p>Would Mr. Obama like salt or salsa on the words he should eat? President Trump is proving that the past can be prologue.</p>

          The city of Seattle with Mount Rainier behind the cityscape.
          <span>(iStock)</span></p></div></div></div>


<p class="speakable">Once again, the oh-so progressive, oh-so enlightened Seattle City Council is showing the rest of the country what <i>not</i> to do. The idealistic leftists who control the Council are wasting millions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars in failed attempts to solve problems the Council members created.</p>


<div class="ad-container tablet"><div data-ad-pos="tablet" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x250" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p class="speakable">All this is turning Seattle into the poster city for the failure of Big Government. The city best known for fish markets, coffee stores, rain and flannel-wearing musicians is now becoming legendary for its incompetent leadership and its financial boondoggles.</p>


<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>


<p>The latest example of Seattle senselessness is the Council’s costly and deeply flawed efforts to get more people riding public transportation and bicycles. Other than spending lots of money, this effort isn’t accomplishing anything.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Seattle was one of the first cities to get electric streetcars in the U.S., <a href="http://www.historylink.org/File/2707" target="_blank">with the first electric car entering service in 1889</a>. With over a century of experience, you would think the city would know how to handle public transit. Not so. Taxpayers are paying a big price for the incompetence of city officials.</p>


<p>The public transportation system in Seattle is a mess. Construction costs for new and upgraded streetcar and light rail lines are skyrocketing well above estimated costs.</p>


<div class="ad-container mobile"><div data-ad-pos="mobile" data-ad-size="300x251" data-ad-lz="" class="ad gpt ad-h-250"></div></div>


<p>One of the more unbelievable mistakes made was the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/can-seattles-streetcar-project-be-canceled-if-an-independent-review-finds-flaws/" target="_blank">purchase of 10 new streetcars last fall</a>. Apparently, when the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) ordered the cars no one thought to check the measurements.</p>


<p>The order was placed for street cars that are <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattles-new-streetcars-may-be-too-big-to-fit-tracks-maintenance-barn/" target="_blank">likely too big for the tracks and the maintenance barn</a>. The project is already $50 million over budget, not including the $52 million it cost for the 10 cars that may be useless. How has no one been fired for this?</p>


<p>Not only is Seattle having problems with its streetcar projects, but its bike lane experiment has also been an unmitigated financial disaster. In 2015, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/move-seattle/" target="_blank">Seattle voters approved a $930 million transportation</a> tax to fund something called called “Move Seattle.”</p>


<p>The nearly $1 billion initiative made bold promises, while increasing average property taxes by $275. One of the bold promises was 50 miles of bike lanes.</p>


<p>Many voiced concerns about the price tag of the ambitious project. After looking at the most recent costs of the bike lanes, their concerns were clearly warranted.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/About/DocumentLibrary/Levy/CB118402FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">The city’s initial budget estimated $854,000</a> per mile for construction of the bike lanes and greenways. Incredibly, so far stretches of the bike lanes are <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2018/04/30/yikes-new-seattle-bike-lanes-were-suppos" target="_blank">costing over 1,000 percent more than expected</a>.</p>


<p>The bike lane on Seventh Avenue clocks in at $13 million per mile, while the Second Avenue lane is $12 million per mile. At this rate, the bike lanes alone will cost more than the entire Move Seattle project.</p>


<p>Of course, no one has been held accountable for the cost overrun, as this is Seattle, where mistakes get people promoted.</p>


<p>Knowing all this, the <a href="https://seattle.curbed.com/2018/7/30/17632624/basic-bike-lane-network-downtown" target="_blank">Seattle City Council still voted</a> to push more bike lane policies. On Monday, a resolution passed calling for SDOT to make sure bike lanes are connected, meaning yet more construction.</p>


<p>I’m not sure what is more infuriating – the fact that a bike lane project that didn’t connect all the lanes was approved in the first place, or that after monumental cost overruns the City Council’s answer was to spend yet more money.</p>


<p>What is truly amazing is that Seattle is trying to increase the number of bicyclists on the street at the same time it wants to increase the streetcar and light rail lines. As any cyclist can attest, rail lines and bicycle tires are a dangerous mix. Expanding both is sure to lead to more accidents.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Lawsuit-Seattle-streetcar-tracks-deadly-to-12457978.php" target="_blank">Seattle and Sound Transit are already being sued for the tragic death of Desiree McCloud</a>. The young woman was in a bike lane when her tire got caught in the train track, causing a horrific crash. McCloud was hospitalized and later died of her injuries.</p>


<p>With its spendthrift and clueless way, the Seattle City Council is showing all Americans the importance of voting in local elections. Too many us of neglect to do this, focusing on elections for president, national and statewide offices.</p>


<p>Local government is closest to the people and in many ways can have the most direct impact on our lives. In Seattle, big-spending liberals trying to fulfill their dreams are creating nightmares for the people of the city.</p>
