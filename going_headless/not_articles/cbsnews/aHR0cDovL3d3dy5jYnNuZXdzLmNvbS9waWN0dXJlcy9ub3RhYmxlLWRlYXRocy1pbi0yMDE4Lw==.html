Born in South Africa, raised in Scotland and educated at Oxford, <strong>Sister Wendy Beckett</strong> (February 25, 1930-December 26, 2018) was a sister of the Catholic Church who taught literature in Cape Town until she suffered three grand mal seizures and was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy. She returned to England in 1970, moving into a trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite Monastery in East Anglia. She would maintain the responsibilities of a hermitic life even after appearing as the host of a BBC documentary series, "Moving Art," in 1991.</p><p>Standing in front of paintings in her nun's habit, Sister Wendy discussed artwork without a script or teleprompter. The series was a hit, and made the 61-year-old an unlikely TV star. Her debut was followed by several other series, including "Sister Wendy's Odyssey," and "Sister Wendy's Grand Tour," in which she visited landmarks of art in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid and elsewhere. She also wrote 15 books on art and religion. </p><p>In 2000 she talked with PBS producer David Willcock about how she chose the American museums to feature in her series "Sister Wendy's American Collection": "If I had stuck just to what I myself love best, every program would have been exactly the same, because each of these museums has superb holdings in my four favorite areas – medieval art, Oriental art, ceramics, and the Old Masters. But nobly, self-sacrificingly, thinking only of the good of others, I forced myself to investigate areas of art into which perhaps I had up to now taken little interest. As always happens with self-sacrifice, I was blissfully rewarded."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Victoria Arocho/AP</p>                    </li>

"It didn't work," she said, not that she had to. Marshall's distinctive voice and smart-alecky delivery were the bedrock of her character Laverne DeFazio, a brewery worker who dreams of better things, in the top-rated '70s sitcom "Laverne &amp; Shirley." The series would take her character from Milwaukee to California during its eight-year run (with even a cartoon spinoff along the way). Her early roles also included Myrna, Oscar's secretary, in "The Odd Couple," and appearances on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Love, American Style."</p><p>But she became a formidable force behind the camera, as the director of the comedies "Big" (featuring Tom Hanks as a 12-year-old boy magically transformed into a 30-year-old boy), and "A League of Their Own" (in which Hanks' coach memorably castigates a player with "There's no crying in baseball!"). Both movies passed the $100 million gross mark, blazing a trail for female-directed films. </p><p>Marshall's other credits included "Awakenings," starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro (only the second film directed by a woman to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar), "The Preacher's Wife," and "Riding in Cars With Boys." </p><p>In her memoir "My Mother Was Nuts," Marshall wrote that she never wanted to grow up, still seeing a connection to the little girl in the Bronx who'd plead with her mom to be allowed to play outside for five more minutes: "Through all the changes and the challenges of adulthood, I have never strayed too far … from that little girl with the ponytail and the overbite who wanted to keep playing for five more minutes." </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Paramount Television/ABC</p>                    </li>

In high school she won a local TV station's talent contest and was given her own program. When she later moved to New York, she soon had a regular gig at The Blue Morocco.

"Within six weeks I had all the things I wanted," she said in an interview. </p><p>Sometimes elegant and understated, or quick and conversational and a little naughty, she was best known for her breakthrough "Guess Who I Saw Today," and the 1964 hit "(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am," which drew upon Broadway, pop and jazz. </p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/Nancy_Wilson_Guess_Who_I_Saw_Today.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play excerpt: "Guess Who I Saw Today"</a></strong></p><p>"How Glad I Am" brought her a Grammy in 1965 for best R&amp;B performance, and she later won Grammys for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2005 for the intimate "R.S.V.P (Rare Songs, Very Personal)," and in 2007 for "Turned to Blue," a showcase for the relaxed, confident swing she mastered later in life.

She won raves, and an Oscar nomination, for her debut film performance.</p><p>She was best known for the six films she made with director and co-star Clint Eastwood (whom she dated for 13 years), starting with the Western "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976), and including "The Gauntlet," "Every Which Way But Loose," "Any Which Way You Can," "Bronco Billy," and the Dirty Harry movie "Sudden Impact."</p><p>Locke also played singer Rosemary Clooney in a 1982 TV biopic, and directed the 1986 film "Ratboy," which flopped in the U.S., but was popular with critics in Europe.  </p><p>In 1997 she released her memoir, titled "The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly: A Hollywood Journey," an account of her tumultuous relationship with Eastwood (she would sue him for palimony, and then fraud), and her battle with breast cancer.

The man claimed to be Howard Hughes, an aviation and business tycoon who spent years in seclusion. "He told me who he was, but I didn't believe him," Dummar told the AP in 2006. "I thought he was just a bum or a prospector or something." Dummar ended up driving the man nearly 190 miles to Las Vegas before giving him some pocket change and dropping him off behind the Sands Hotel.</p><p>About eight years later, after Hughes died, a handwritten will, rife with misspellings, was dropped off at Dummar's gas station, addressed to the Mormon Church. The will named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as beneficiary of $156 million – a 1/16 share of the Hughes estate – and also bequeathed $156 million to Dummar for rescuing him in the desert.</p><p>For years Dummar, whose story was depicted in the 1980 film "Melvin and Howard" (starring Paul Le Mat as Dummar and Jason Robards as Hughes), fought legal battles over the authenticity of the will. Jurors and judges decided against him. "I've been called everything from a crook to a forger," Dummar told the AP in 2007 in Utah, where he was then running a business selling frozen meat. "I don't care what people say - as long as they get the facts straight."</p><p>In 2005 a retired FBI agent uncovered new evidence and witnesses supporting Dummar's claim of finding Hughes and driving him to the Sands, and about the delivery of the envelope containing the will. But in 2008 a U.S. appeals court affirmed a Nevada state court jury's decision 30 years earlier that found the will was a fake.</p><p>"You've got to keep on living," Dummar told the Salt Lake Tribune in 2005 about his set-backs. But as the aspiring songwriter wrote in "All-American Dreamer":</p><p><em>Some say I'll never make it. <br> But one day I will score. <br> Some say I've lost the battle. <br> But I don't think I've lost the war.</em></p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn." It was partially a prescient statement: <strong>President George H.W. Bush</strong> (June 12, 1924-November 30, 2018) would soon watch as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union dissolved, ending a decades-long Cold War. But he also spearheaded an international military strike against Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi dictator invaded neighboring Kuwait.</p><p>Born in 1924, the second-oldest son of investment banker and future Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, he served as the Navy's youngest pilot during World War II, and was shot down in the Pacific over the island of Chichi Jima. After marrying Barbara Pierce, he became an oil man in Texas before entering <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a>. A Congressman, RNC Chairman, United Nations Ambassador, Envoy to China and CIA Director, Bush would become Vice President under Ronald Reagan before succeeding him in office. [He would also become only the second U.S. president to see his own son become a president himself.] </p><p>Following the Gulf War, in 1991, President Bush's approval rating was nearly 90%. And yet, the following year he lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton, owing to his having broken his 1988 campaign mantra: "Read my lips: no new taxes." In his concession speech he allowed that he would continue to find ways to serve the public, while also getting active in "the grandchild business."</p><p>Coming from a family that prized public service, Mr. Bush had heralded "a thousand points of light" as a marker of community and volunteerism, and promoted those efforts beyond the White House. He also worked with fellow former presidents to raise millions for hurricane disaster relief and recovery. And if age ever got the better of him, it was hard to tell: on his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays he marked the occasion by skydiving. </p><p>He was as accepting about his 1992 election loss as his public demeanor suggested. In a 1996 interview for "Sunday Morning," Mr. Bush told Paula Zahn, "There wasn't any period of self pity or thinking, on the other side of it, thinking you were entitled to a grand lifestyle.  … There was no [more] decision-making. Went from one day making decisions, getting worried about getting a call that something was wrong, the next day nothing, nobody gives a damn about what I thought, cared.

Beginning his career as an assistant director for Pier Paolo Pasolini, he made his first film, "The Grim Reaper," about the murder of a prostitute, in 1962. By the early 1970s, he had already directed several acclaimed features, including "Before the Revolution," "The Spider's Strategem," and "The Conformist," a visually astonishing tale of a bureaucrat (Jean-Louis Trintignant) subsuming himself to the orders of Mussolini's secret police.</p><p>It was his bold and improvisational 1973 feature "Last Tango in Paris," starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider as a middle-aged man and younger woman engaged in a brutal sexual relationship, that earned Berlotucci both critical kudos and censorship. (The movie was banned in Italy.) He would later win two <a href="/oscars/" data-is-autolink="true">Academy Awards</a> for writing and directing the sumptuous 1987 biopic "The Last Emperor" (pictured), the first Western production to be shot in Beijing's Forbidden City. </p><p>Bertolucci's other films include the five-hour epic "1900," about Italy during the rise of fascism, starring Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu and Dominique Sanda; "The Sheltering Sky," based on the Paul Bowles novel of an American couple's disintegrating relationship during a trip to Africa; "Little Buddha," about Siddharta; and "The Dreamers," an erotic drama set against the 1968 student riots in Paris. </p><p>In 2014 Bertolucci talked with <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-bernardo-bertolucci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Film Comment magazine</a> about "Last Tango," his most talked-about film. (Schneider complained that Bertolucci had not properly warned her about the improvisational sex scenes.)</p><p>"When I started, I didn't know where I could go with Marlon Brando and Maria. Because there is something that you can't tell in the screenplays – and it's exactly what's missing from screenplays, which is the flesh and blood of the real people in front of the camera. The script describes the characters, but when you go to shoot, you try to invent life in front of the camera."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Neal Ulevich/AP</p>                    </li>

He would later direct David Bowie in the sci-fi classic "The Man Who Fell to Earth."</p><p>Known for provocative stories, he was perhaps best known for the 1973 thriller "Don't Look Now," based on the Daphne Du Maurier tale, about a couple (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) mourning their daughter's death, who encounter strange goings-on with a psychic in Venice. Other notable credits include "Walkabout," set in the Australian outback; "Bad Timing: A Sensual Obsession"; "Insignificance"; and Roald Dahl's "The Witches."</p><p>Much of Roeg's acclaim for his work, from critics, other filmmakers, or ticket buyers, came after-the-fact, long after his films first hit screens, a fact that did not strike him with pleasure in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/10/nicolas-roeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2011 Guardian interview</a>, when it was suggested he was "ahead of his time."  </p><p>"I hate that expression," Roeg said.

That was the sage advice of Oscar-winning screenwriter <strong>William Goldman</strong> (August 12, 1931-November 16, 2018) when asked for the secret of what made a successful film.</p><p>He <em>should</em> have known; Goldman won <a href="/oscars/" data-is-autolink="true">Academy Awards</a> for writing "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men" (for which he coined the immortal phrase "Follow the money"). He also wrote the screenplays for "The Princess Bride," "Marathon Man" and "Magic" (each adapted from his own novels), "Harper," "The Hot Rock," "The Stepford Wives," "The Great Waldo Pepper," "Misery" and "The Ghost and the Darkness," among others. </p><p>After the Chicago-born Goldman received his master's degree from Columbia University in 1956, he penned a novel, "The Temple of Gold," in under two weeks, and sold it to Knopf. More than 20 novels followed (some published under pen names), including "Soldier in the Rain" and "No Way to Treat a Lady," both of which became films. Goldman found work in movies himself (as did his older brother, James Goldman, who would win the Oscar for adapting his historical play, "The Lion in Winter"). In addition to his own screenplays, he also found service as a highly sought-after script doctor on such films as "A Few Good Men," "Twins," "Dolores Claiborne," "Malice" and "Indecent Proposal."</p><p>In 1983 as his career was beginning to cool (a screenplay he'd written for "The Right Stuff" was rejected), he wrote a memoir of his years in Hollywood, "Adventures in the Screen Trade," an invaluable treatise on the business and art of filmmaking. Other non-fiction books included "Wait Till Next Year," a collection of sports writing; and "Hype and Glory," about his experience judging the Cannes Film Festival. </p><p>Goldman always wanted to write, but his early aspiration was to be a sports writer, and he did not seem to take the results of his Hollywood labors too seriously. In "William Goldman: The Reluctant Storyteller," he rejected analysis of his work. "I'm just trying to tell a story," he said. "I wrote a movie called 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' and I wrote a novel called "The Princess Bride,' and those are the only two things I've ever written, not that I'm proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation." </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

"That sounds good. So I started trying to think of some names. Insect-man? Nah. Mosquito-man? Nah. And then I got to Spider-man. Spider-man, <em>ooh, that sounds dramatic!</em>  And if he has spider power, he can shoot a web also. And he could swing ... oh man! And then I figured I'd make him a teenager, and I figured I would do the unthinkable: I'd give him personal problems.</p><p>"I ran into my publisher and I said, 'Have I got an idea for you! His name is Spider-man ...' And I couldn't get any further. He said, 'Stan, that is the worst idea I have ever heard!'"</p><p>The rest, of course, is the stuff of comic book lore, one of the premier characters Lee helped create at Marvel. He was the comic book company's top writer, and later its publisher. Working with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Lee's wild ideas helped bring Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, Black Panther, and the Fantastic Four to life, making Lee a God of the Marvel Universe. </p><p>But it wasn't just his childhood fascination with Errol Flynn that inspired his comic books' derring-do. His superheroes had super powers, but also flaws, arguing amongst themselves and dealing with hang-ups – all key ingredients that went into his most famous character of all: Spider-man. His characters could also offer social commentary, refusing to shy away from the issues of the day, like war, race relations and drug abuse. </p><p>Lee's genius for vivid characters and stories left a mark on the popular imagination of generations of comic book fans, which translated to theatergoers when Marvel movies (in which he habitually appeared in cameos, with a nod and a wink) became box office powerhouses. </p><p>In a 2006 Associated Press interview Lee said of his comic book stories, "I think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. ... I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Reed Saxon/AP Photo</p>                    </li>

A former student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in London, he was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada and a founding member of the Stratford Festival, in Ontario, where he spent 32 seasons performing Shakespeare. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in "Vivat! Vivat! Regina!"</p><p>But his most indelible role came as a result of narrating a 1960 National Film Board of Canada short, "Universe," the visual effects of which had inspired Kubrick. The director turned to Rain to voice his on-board computer, after deciding the recorded performance by Martin Balsam was too emotional. </p><p>A supposedly perfect artificial intelligence who covers up a mistake by attributing it to "human error," and whose dialogue drips with irony, Hal murders the ship's crew members before he is "lobotomized" by the mission's sole survivor, David Bowman (played by Keir Dullea). Rain was chillingly neutral, whether talking about chess or locking an astronaut outside the ship. When asked by Bowman to let him back inside, Hal flatly responds, "I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." </p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/2001_Douglas_Rain_as_Hal_9000.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excerpt: Douglas Rain as Hal in "2001: A Space Odyssey"</a></strong></p><p>Rain would return as Hal in the 1984 sequel, "2010," and was heard in an uncredited performance as a computer in Woody Allen's "Sleeper." He also narrated the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, "The Man Who Skied Down Everest." And Hal's flat delivery would inspire Anthony Hopkins' performance as serial killer Hannibal Lecter.</p><p>Given his half-century career as a stage, radio and TV actor, Rain was dismissive of his immortal performance in "2001," which encompassed two days in a sound booth being fed lines by Kubrick. "If you could have been a ghost at the recording session," Rain recalled for the <a href="http://2010odysseyarchive.blogspot.com/2015/01/douglas-rain-immortal-voice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"2010 Odyssey Archive" blog</a>, "you would have thought it was a load of rubbish."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Stratford Festival; MGM/Warner Brothers</p>                    </li>

Their idea to take computers out of university and research labs and put them in people's hands was sparked in 1974, in Boston (Gates was then attending Harvard, Allen was a college dropout), when they came across a notice for a new small computer sold to hobbyists, the Altair. In eight weeks Allen and Gates wrote code that could run on the Altair and pitched it to the company. It was the birth of Microsoft, a giant in personal and business computing.</p><p>After creating the code MS-Basic, Microsoft developed and refined the operating system for IBM computers, which became the core of IBM PCs and clones. By 1991, Microsoft's operating systems (and such programs as Word and Excel) were used by 93 percent of the world's personal computers. Allen was Microsoft's executive vice president of research and new product development until 1983, when he resigned after being diagnosed with cancer – and he pursued a wide range of interests with the passion of a cancer survivor. "To be 30 years old and have that kind of shock – to face your mortality – really makes you feel like you should do some of the things that you haven't done yet," Allen said in a 2000 book, "Inside Out: Microsoft in Our Own Words." </p><p>One of the world's richest men, he devoted more than $2 billion of his wealth to philanthropy (including founding the Allen Institute for Brain Science). He also spent on such interests as music (he played in his own rock 'n' roll band, and built Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture), sports (he bought the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers), science (he funded an antenna farm listening for signals from outer space, and built the aerospace firm Stratolaunch), movies (he invested in DreamWorks), and travel (he built a yacht longer than a football field, equipped with its own submarine).</p><p>"Look, in the Microsoft days, you had some great ideas and some great execution between me and Bill and many other people," he told <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-allen-and-the-birth-of-the-pc-microsoft-2011-60-minutes-interview/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">"60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl in 2011</a>.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."</p><p>A London native fascinated by music and technology from an early age, Emerick was an invaluable part of the Beatles' legacy as they became increasingly ambitious and experimental in the studio (including the embrace of effects like backward tape loops and double tracking). He was on hand as an assistant during the Beatles' early EMI sessions in 1962, and was promoted in the mid-1960s. </p><p>Producer George Martin recalled in a 1990s documentary that Emerick was unconventional: "He used to do really weird things [with microphones] that were slightly illegitimate, with our support and approval." His innovations on "Sgt. Pepper" included enhancing the sound of Ringo Starr's drums on "A Day in the Life" by loosening the skins and wrapping a microphone in a tea cloth and placing it in a glass container. McCartney also recorded bass lines after the rest of a given track was done – an unusual practice at the time.</p><p>Emerick became frustrated during the recording of the "White Album" and briefly quit, but returned for "Abbey Road," and worked with Paul McCartney on his solo "Band On the Run" album.

He would reject the austere designs and spare aesthetics of modernists like Mies van der Rohe, and produce buildings that celebrated complexity and even inconsistency in design.</p><p>Venturi designed buildings bursting with ornamentation and flourishes, and encouraged architects and consumers to enjoy "messy vitality" in architecture, whether whimsical, sarcastic, humorous or honky-tonk. His first notable building was a house he designed for his mother in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood in 1961. It broke from the established architectural thinking of the time, that a modern house should contain no historical elements. Architect Frederick Schwartz referred to the Vanna Venturi House (pictured) as "the first postmodern anything."</p><p>"A while back, when it was considered very daring, we did very simple things," Venturi said in 1991. "We did buildings that looked ordinary, that were not trying to be revolutionary the way modern architecture was going to go. That horrified people. We did houses that looked like houses, elemental concepts of houses. We did fire stations that looked like fire stations."</p><p>In 1991, Venturi was awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize, for "expanding and redefining the limits of architecture in this century, as perhaps no other has."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> George Widman, AP; Carol M.

There he befriended such music greats as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, and Igor Stravinsky.

A year later he became a soloist for Martha Graham, while continuing to shape his own company into one of the world's most successful contemporary troupes.</p><p>The pairing of classical music (particularly 18th-century Baroque) with modern dance was one of Taylor's hallmarks.

He was also the first black African to lead the world body, from 1997 to 2006.</p><p>From the outset of his tenure, Annan struggled to restore the U.N.'s tarnished reputation (including notable failures by the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, which he had previously lead). When he departed, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for its 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development. He was chief architect of what became known as the Millennium Development Goals, and played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the U.N.'s first counter-terrorism strategy.</p><p>Despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, Annan was never afraid to speak candidly. That didn't always win him fans, particularly in the case of President George W. Bush's administration, with whom Annan's camp spent much time bickering. Much of his second term was spent at odds with the United States, the U.N.'s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on it to pay almost $2 billion in arrears, at the same time he pushed against the invasion of Iraq. </p><p>Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He returned in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League's special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his eponymous foundation, which in 2007 helped broker peace in Kenya, where election violence had killed over 1,000 people.</p><p>At the end of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, in 2001, Annan reminded the world of the importance of the U.N.: "Beneath the surface of states and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate of individual human beings in need," he said. </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images</p>                    </li>

She won two Grammys that year (she would go on to win a total of 18), and followed that breakout success with such classics as "Think," "I Say a Little Prayer," "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)," "Freeway of Love," and "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)." </p><p>Her range ran the gamut from gospel, R&amp;B and jazz to rock and pop.

Naipaul</strong> (August 17, 1932-August 11, 2018), the first writer of Indian origin to win the Booker Prize, traveled as a self-described "barefoot colonial" from his rural childhood in Trinidad to an Oxford education in England, and would be hailed as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Naipaul's books (including "The Enigma of Arrival," "Finding the Centre" and "The Enigma of Arrival") explored colonialism and decolonization, exile and the struggles of the everyman in the developing world. He was critical of colonialism (he would repeatedly reject his birthplace as little more than a plantation), but saw himself as a realist, cured of illusions. His outlook was characterized by the famous opening words of "A Bend in the River": "The world is what it is."</p><p>After working as a writer for the BBC, he earned plaudits for a string of novels, and traveled extensively to pen journalistic essays and books on culture, <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a> and religion. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2001 "for having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories."</p><p>"If you come from the New World, as I in large measure do, you see all the absurd fantasies people have taken there and the troubles they have wrought as a result," Naipaul told The Associated Press in 2000. "We were not given a proper history of the New World itself. This was not out of wickedness. It was out of ignorance, out of indifference, out of the feelings that the history of this very small island was not important. These aspects one had to learn, and writing took me there.

Surpassing the average four-week life expectancy of RAF pilots during the war, he flew between 50 and 60 sorties during the Battle of Britain, shooting down or damaging several German planes. Wellum was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and was later promoted to flight commander. </p><p>Years later, as he faced divorce and the loss of his house, he told the Independent, "I just wanted to sit quietly and convince myself that at some point in my life I had been of use." Wellum penned a memoir, which would later be published as the bestseller "First Light," hailed as a remarkably emotional tale of a young man coming of age inside the cockpit of a fighter plane. It was later turned into a BBC film, which Wellum himself judged to be the most authentic rendering of the Battle of Britain, surpassing even the 1969 epic "with all the big chaps in it," he told Forces TV.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Cecil Beaton/Imperial War Museums</p>                    </li>

American youths fighting overseas, however, were not into "drab, sterile announcements" with middle-of-the-road music, Cronauer told The Associated Press in 1987. The battle over the airwaves was joined: "I wanted to serve the listeners."</p><p>His military radio antics inspired the character played by Robin Williams in the film "Good Morning, Vietnam," who drops Perry Como and Lawrence Welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the Dave Clark Five. Cronauer loved the movie but admitted much of it was Hollywood make-believe, explaining, "Yes, I did try to make it sound more like a stateside station. Yes, I did have problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by yelling, 'Good Morning, Vietnam!'"</p><p>The rest was invention on the part of Hollywood scriptwriters and Williams' improvisational genius. "If I did even half the things that Robin did in the movie, I'd still be in Leavenworth!" Cronauer told journalist Rick Fredericksen in 2014.</p><p>After the military, he worked in radio, television and advertising. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania's law school and worked in communications law. He later handled prisoner-of-war issues for the Pentagon. "I always was a bit of an iconoclast, as Robin was in the film," Cronauer told the AP in 1999. A lifelong, card-carrying Republican, he said he was not anti-military or anti-establishment: "I was anti-stupidity. And you certainly do run into a lot of stupidity in the military." </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Adrian Cronauer, courtesy of Paul Bottoms; Thanks to AFVNvets.net</p>                    </li>

The shy boy - abandoned by his father and raised by a domineering mother - joined the Coast Guard at 15 by lying about his age. An equestrian and figure skater, he emerged a star in the 1952 potboiler "Island of Desire." Soon after, the handsome, muscular Hunter appeared on a flood of magazine covers, nabbed a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, and won the admiration of millions of teenage girls as the "Sigh Guy." He starred in the films "Battle Cry," "The Burning Hills" (opposite Natalie Wood), "They Came to Cordura" (with Gary Cooper), and "Damn Yankees!" He also topped the Billboard chart in 1957 with his recording of "Young Love"</p><p>Rumors about the actor's homosexuality burned up the scandal sheets, but he continued working under the studio-projected image of him as a teen heartthrob. "I was living a lie, absolutely," he told "Sunday Morning" in 2005. "I was another person. I mean, my sexuality was my sexuality. And it was not what people perceived. You know, people believe what they want to believe. But this was very difficult for me."</p><p>His career ebbed to a short-lived TV show and cheap exploitation flicks ("Ride the Wild Surf"), and small roles in "The Loved One," ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean" and "Grease 2." But in the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, most notably John Waters' 1981 "Polyester" and Paul Bartel's 1985 "Lust in the Dust."</p><p>In his 2005 memoir, "Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star," Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man. "I believed, wholeheartedly - still do - that a person's happiness depends on being true to themselves," he wrote. "The dilemma, of course, was that being true to myself - and I'm talking sexually now - was impossible in 1953."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

Diaz spent the next few months chatting with Elian Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child.</p><p>Because of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before Easter in 2000. Diaz's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo shows an armed U.S. immigration agent reaching out toward the terrified six-year-old, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's Little Havana home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba.  </p><p>After the picture hit the wires and network news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless. "I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all," Diaz said last year. "Good or bad, that's what happened that morning."</p><p>During his career Diaz, who was known to roar, "Hello, Miami!" every time he entered the AP's South Florida office, shot World Series games, recovery efforts after 9/11, hurricanes, and, memorably, the magnified eye of an election official trying to make sense of a hanging chad during the disputed 2000 Florida recount.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Alan Diaz, Wilfredo Lee/AP</p>                    </li>

He brought that pugnacious style to his work, penning nightmarish, sometimes darkly humorous stories. He wrote some 50 books and more than 1,400 articles, essays, TV scripts and screenplays, and earned nearly a dozen Nebula and Hugo awards.</p><p>He once said he wanted his stories "to grab you by the throat and tear off parts of your body."</p><p>Some of his most popular works were surrealistic fantasies set in grisly worlds run by totalitarians and conformists. "A Boy and His Dog," set in a world devastated by nuclear war, featured a protagonist who communicated with his dog via telepathy; he recently expanded the novella into a full-length novel, "Blood's A Rover." He edited the seminal 1967 sci-fi anthology "Dangerous Visions," and his short story, "I Have No Mouth &amp; I Must Scream," is about the last humans, eternally tortured by a malevolent, godlike computer. </p><p>His 1967 "Star Trek" episode, "The City on the Edge of Forever," is thought by many to be the best ever, in which a young woman played by Joan Collins is saved from a fatal accident by the starship Enterprise's time-traveling Dr. McCoy. Later, the ship's Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock learn they must return to the year 1930 and let her die or history will be changed and Nazi Germany will win World War II.</p><p>"Harlan Ellison: There was no one quite like him in American letters, and never will be," author Stephen King Tweeted. "Angry, funny, eloquent, hugely talented. If there's an afterlife, Harlan is already kicking ass and taking down names."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

His Peabody Award-winning CNN series "Parts Unknown" showed viewers the one common ingredient to the kaleidoscopic cultures of the Earth: meats, fish, veggies, breads, spices, sauces and alcohol, in all their dizzying combinations.</p><p>But he knew better than other TV chefs that the sensual pleasures of food are often irremovable from the places in which they originated – hence the treks to lands that were exotic (or at least filmed and edited in a smashingly exotic manner), which were gastronomic excuses to sit with families and friends for gossip, local history, <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a>, and lore about food.</p><p>His celebrity was born from his 2000 book, "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly," and his early TV series, "A Cook's Tour" (for the Food Network), and the Travel Channel's "No Reservations," which won two Emmys. As a storyteller, both of his own journey through life (overcoming drug addiction and rising to become an executive chef in New York) and about the cultures into which he dipped his toes, Bourdain was unparalleled   – melding ego, curiosity and appetite into one boisterous, entertaining stew. </p><p>In the book "My City, My New York" (2011), Bourdain offered this: "I've often said that cooking is a dominant act, it's an alpha act. But eating should be a submissive act. And chefs are at their happiest when they go to a restaurant and know someone in charge is cooking well. When that happens, I can completely switch over to the other side and experience it washing over me.

Unlike many Bond Girls who would meet untimely ends during the franchise's 50-year-plus history, Gayson's character actually returned the following year in "From Russia With Love."</p><p>In a 2012 interview with the Daily Record, Gayson explained that she helped Connery overcome nerves on the very first day of production when he kept bumbling his now-iconic opening line. Taking him to lunch and pretending to imbibe, she encouraged him to go off the wagon and loosen up with a drink. He downed two. "Well, not having had a drink for so long, it really affected him, but in a nice sort of way – all his nerves seemed to go out the window," she said. "We went back on set and he said the name 'Bond, James Bond' in a beautiful way."</p><p>Gayson's stage appearances included "Born Yesterday," "No, No Nanette" and "The Sound of Music," and she returned to the London stage in the 1990s in "Into the Woods."

Assigned to oversee the candidate's visit, Tuck – a WWII vet studying under the GI Bill (and who was actually working for Douglas) – hired a large hall and invited a smattering of people, leaving more than 1,900 empty seats.

Kennedy with the reassuring, "That's all right, you'll do better next time," or having people in San Francisco's Chinatown hold up a sign in Chinese asking about a questionable loan billionaire Howard Hughes gave to Nixon's brother. Informed of the translation, Nixon ripped up the sign.</p><p>"I never tried to be malicious," Tuck told Time magazine in 1973 of his pranks, from altering the slips of paper inside fortune cookies to embarrass a candidate during a fundraiser, to directing garbage trucks to troll the GOP convention, to hiring pregnant women wearing T-shirts reading, "Nixon's the One." And the wit of his pranks found a reluctant admirer in Nixon himself, who was heard on the White House tapes comparing Tuck's work favorably to his own team's "dirty tricks."</p><p>"I've made a lot of candidates look foolish," Tuck was quoted as saying, "usually with a lot of help from the candidates themselves." </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP</p>                    </li>

And "Portnoy's Complaint," his blockbuster novel ten years later, grabbed national attention with its frankness about sex. "Sex is important," <strong>Philip Roth</strong> (March 19, 1933-May 22, 2018) told CBS News' Rita Braver in 2010. "And sex plays a big part in people's lives. Plays a huge part in their imaginations. Plays a huge part in their fantasies. And therefore, it's a subject for writing."</p><p>Roth would be heralded as "America'a greatest living novelist," with his discourses on the Jewish experience and assimilation in 20th century America. His 30 novels include "Operation Shylock" (1993), set against the backdrop of the trial in Israel of a Nazi war criminal; "The Human Stain" (2000), about the effects of accusations of racism; "The Plot Against America" (2044), an alternate history in which President Charles Lindbergh leads the nation down the path of fascism; and "Nemesis" (2010), about a polio epidemic in his hometown of Newark, N.J. in the 1940s.</p><p>He received the Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel "American Pastoral," twice received the National Book Award, and received the Man Booker International Prize for his body of work. </p><p>An atheist, Roth was asked by Braver what he wished his legacy would be. "Oh, gosh! When does the legacy begin?" Roth asked. </p><p>"I think when you're gone. Way down the line."</p><p>"When I'm gone, huh," Roth said. "Okay. I don't worry about that." </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> ERIC THAYER/REUTERS</p>                    </li>

His work broke countless rules, but was grounded in old-school, shoe-leather reporting. "Nothing fuels the imagination more than real facts do," Wolfe told the AP in 1999. "As the saying goes, 'You can't make this stuff up.'"</p><p>His book "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" captured the '60s psychedelic culture and his travels with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. His magazine piece, "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's," took a pointed look at fund-raising for the Black Panther Party by Leonard Bernstein and other wealthy whites. Other collections included "The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby," and "The Pump-House Gang." His seminal non-fiction work was "The Right Stuff," his lofty paean to test pilots and Mercury astronauts. </p><p>Asked in 2006 by "Sunday Morning" if he saw himself as a voyeur or a reporter, Wolfe laughed: "I don't think you can separate [the two], but most voyeurs are stupid because they don't get paid for it."</p><p>In the mid-1980s he turned to fiction with "The Bonfire of the Vanities," a sweeping, satirical story about New York City's social inequities, racism, and Wall Street's "Masters of the Universe." First serialized in Rolling Stone, it was published in 1987 and became a critical and commercial blockbuster. Wolfe followed with more fiction, including "A Man in Full," "I Am Charlotte Simmons" and "Back to Blood."</p><p>In 1986 Wolfe suffered a massive heart attack and underwent a quintuple bypass, which both saved his life and changed it. "As the Stoic Epictetus used to say, 'You're nothing but a piece of crockery and a quart of blood,'" he told "<a href="/60-minutes/" data-is-autolink="true">60 Minutes</a>" correspondent Morley Safer in 1988.

Their unforgettable on-screen pairing fostered a strong friendship that lasted for decades, until Reeve's early death in 2004. "When you're strapped to someone hanging from the ceiling for months and months, you get pretty darned close," Kidder told CBS' "The Insider."</p><p>But prior to her star turn as the spunky reporter, Kidder battled manic mood swings – experiences which actually led to her pursuit of acting, and to being cast as troubled teenagers in Canadian TV shows. She starred with Gene Wilder in "Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx," appeared opposite Robert Redford in "The Great Waldo Pepper," and portrayed twins (one a murderess) in the Brian De Palma thriller "Sisters." After her "Superman" breakout, Kidder's films included "The Amityville Horror," "Willie &amp; Phil," "Heartaches," "Some Kind of Hero" and "Trenchcoat."</p><p>But her professional career was hampered by financial problems and depression. Bipolar, she suffered a paranoia-fueled breakdown in 1996 when a computer virus destroyed three years' worth of writing on her laptop that could not be salvaged. She was found after disappearing for four days in the hills of Los Angeles, received help, and would eventually resume acting (and writing).

Lazarus</strong> (October 4, 1923-March 22, 2018) opened Children's Bargain Town, a baby furniture store in Washington, D.C. He began selling baby toys, and quickly concluded that - in the baby-boom years - toys were a more lucrative business than furniture. (How many parents buy a new crib for their second baby?)  </p><p>Using a self-service supermarket business model, he turned the company he founded, Toys R Us, into one of the first retail category giants: a chain of big stores devoted to one thing. The stores' circus-like atmosphere - aimed at making kids want to keep coming back - was amplified by its mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe, who appeared in his first TV commercial in 1973. By the 1980s and early '90s, Toys R Us dominated the retail toy industry.</p><p>In an interview with videographer Mark Aaron, posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;v=JG2W0F_rdvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube</a>, Lazarus described the toy industry as a happy business. "You've gotta be kind of kid-like," he said. "When you look at what the creativity of the toy market is, you have to have imagination. You have to think like a child."</p><p>Lazarus stepped down as CEO of Toys R Us in 1994. Since then, competition from retailers like Walmart and online sellers like Amazon, and the rise of online diversions, would drive Toys R Us, in March 2018, into bankruptcy. </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Cheryl Chenet/Getty Images</p>                    </li>

Hawking was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, when he was a student at Cambridge; doctors believed it would kill him in his early 20s. But despite his condition - confined to a wheelchair, and in later years speaking via a voice synthesizer - he was able to pursue his studies of quantum mechanics, gravity, black holes, and a Unified Theory of Cosmology.</p><p>As slowly as a word per minute, Hawking used the twitching of the muscle under his right eye to grind out his thoughts on a custom-built computer. What he produced was a masterwork of popular science, a guidebook through the esoteric world of anti-particles, quarks, and quantum theory. </p><p>Hawking's other major scientific contribution was to cosmology, the study of the universe's origin and evolution. Working with Jim Hartle of UC, Santa Barbara, Hawking proposed in 1983 that space and time might have no beginning and no end. "Asking what happens before the Big Bang is like asking for a point one mile north of the North Pole," he said.</p><p>Hawking appeared in several documentaries, and played himself (or at least a holographic version of Stephen Hawking) in a 1993 episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." His life was dramatized in the 2014 film "The Theory of Everything," starring Eddie Redmayne. </p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Getty Images</p>                    </li>

Once you're unafraid on stage to do the storm scene in 'Lear' or be the ghost in 'Hamlet,' you can summon all those images of size and space and vividness in front of a microphone."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> CBS</p>                    </li>

In 2017, she starred in "Mom," playing a woman out to seek vengeance for the rape of her teenage stepdaughter.</p><p>Shortly before her passing, she described her acting career to Indian media: "No one else from my family had ever acted.

Billy Graham</strong> (November 7, 1918-February 21, 2018) dedicated his life to preaching the Gospel when he was 16. Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1939, he created his own brand of populist evangelism. His "crusades," as he called them, were soon attracting millions in person and later through television. Over seven decades he spoke to the faithful in 185 countries. A staunch anti-Communist, one of his cherished ambitions was to bring the message of Jesus Christ to the officially atheist countries behind the Iron Curtain, as well as to China.</p><p>Graham became a counselor and confidante to every American president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, but Graham himself denied he had a role in making policy. He said: "I don't advise them, I pray with them."</p><p>Despite his proximity to power, Graham was resolutely nonpartisan, and his ethics and emphasis on cooperation among different faiths earned him widespread respect. In moments of national crisis, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, Graham was sought out for his ability to comfort and console with simplicity and eloquence. "We've been reminded that a cruel event like this, which so vividly demonstrates the depths of human evil, also brings out the best of us," Graham said.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Getty Images</p>                    </li>

A trumpeter, singer and composer, Masekela started playing the horn at 14. He quickly became an integral part of the 1950s jazz scene in Johannesburg. In the 1960s he went into exile in the United Kingdom and the United States, while spreading awareness about South Africa's oppressive system of white-minority rule. Many of his compositions were about the struggle for majority rule and full democratic rights in South Africa.</p><p>He scored an international No. 1 hit in 1968 with his instrumental "Grazing in the Grass." His catchy upbeat 1987 song "Bring Him Back Home" calling for Nelson Mandela's release from prison became an international anthem for the anti-apartheid movement. In the 1980s he appeared with Paul Simon as part of the "Graceland" album tour.</p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/Hugh_Masekela_Grazing_In_The_Grass.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excerpt: "Grazing in the Grass"</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/Hugh_Masekela_Bring_Him_Back_Home.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excerpt: "Bring Him Back Home"</a></strong></p><p>Masekela returned to South Africa in 1990 after Mandela was freed and the ban on the African National Congress party lifted. </p><p>"My biggest obsession is to show Africans and the world who the people of Africa really are," Masekela said on his website.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Triloka Records</p>                    </li>
