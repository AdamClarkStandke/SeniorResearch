<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Who is Harvey Weinstein?</h2>


<p>The 67-year-old is one of Hollywood's most famous producers and has worked on a number of award-winning films, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist.</p>


<p>In total, the films he worked on have generated over 81 Oscars since 1999 and founded the Miramax entertainment company in the 1970s, which initially focused on art-house films. </p>


<p>In 2005, he split from Miramax and founded Weinstein Co, alongside his brother Bob. </p>


<p>In 2017, Quartz reported that Mr Weinstein had become so powerful in Hollywood that <a href="https://qz.com/1101213/harvey-weinstein-is-one-of-the-most-thanked-people-in-oscars-history/" class="story-body__link-external">he had been thanked as many times as God in Oscar acceptance speeches. </a></p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How did the scandal unfold? </h2>


<p>In October 2017, the New York Times published a story <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" class="story-body__link-external">detailing decades of allegations</a> of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. </p>


<p>Actresses Rose McGowan and Ms Judd were among the first women to come forward. </p>


<p>The accusations include forcing women to massage him and watch him naked. He also allegedly promised to help some women advance their careers in return for sexual favours.</p>


<p>The film producer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41520007" class="story-body__link">issued an apology</a> acknowledging he had "caused a lot of pain" - but denied allegations that he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. </p>


<p>The outcry against Mr Weinstein led to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment.</p>


<ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-44045291" class="story-body__link">What has #MeToo actually changed?</a></li></ul>


<p>As the accusations mounted, his company Weinstein Co dismissed him and filed for bankruptcy.</p>


<p>Mr Weinstein is due to go on trial in New York on 3 June on five charges of sexually assaulting two women. If found guilty, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The world's largest concert promoter, Live Nation, says it will eliminate single-use plastics at its venues and festivals by 2021.</p>


<p>In the UK, that means events like Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Latitude and Download will go plastic free.</p>


<p>It's part of a push to achieve zero waste at Live Nation's clubs, concert halls and venues by 2030.</p>


<p>The pledge comes after independent British festivals like Glastonbury and Bestival vowed to cut plastic waste.</p>


<p>Glastonbury has announced it will not sell single-use plastic water bottles this year, owing to concerns about their impact on the environment.</p>

<p>While Bestival, Boardmasters and Kendal Calling were among 61 festivals who signed up to the "<a href="https://aiforg.com/drastic-on-plastic/" class="story-body__link-external">drastic on plastic</a>" initiative last year, pledging to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021.</p>


<p>They have also called on retailers such as Argos and Tesco to stop marketing and selling tents as single-use items, saying abandoned tents account for 875 tonnes of plastic waste every summer.</p>

</ul>


<p>Awareness of the impact of plastic on the environment has grown exponentially over the last few years. </p>


<p>It's thought that more than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, harming wildlife and entering the food chain.</p>


<p>This week, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48358002" class="story-body__link">the government announced new restrictions</a> on the sale of plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds, which will come into effect in England from April 2020.</p>

<p>Live Nation's commitment will affect about 20 UK festivals and more than 20 venues, which it manages through the Academy Music Group. </p>


<p>These include high-profile concert halls such as the Brixton Academy, King Tut's Wah-Wah Hut in Glasgow, the Manchester Apollo and Cardiff International Arena.</p>

<li class="story-body__list-item">Toiletry bottles (hand-wash, shower gel, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>Live Nation says it will start trialling plant-based water bottles across Europe in 2019.   </p>


<p>It has also launched a <a href="https://www.livenationentertainment.com/2019/05/live-nation-sets-sustainability-goals-for-concerts-and-live-events-as-part-of-ongoing-green-nation-program/" class="story-body__link-external">new set of sustainability goals</a>, including a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030; and a commitment to send zero waste to landfill by 2030.</p>


<p>"Hosting over 35,000 concerts and festivals each year, Live Nation has the opportunity and responsibility to provide our artists and fans with a live music experience that protects our planet," said Michael Rapino, president of Live Nation Entertainment. </p>


<p>"The adverse effects of climate change are undeniable, and we want to use our place on the world stage to be part of the solution. Together our concerts, venues, festivals, and offices around the world are setting new sustainability standards for live events."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Three more climbers have died on Mount Everest, taking the death toll to seven in a week - more than the total for the whole of last year.</p>


<p>The three died of exhaustion while descending on Thursday.</p>


<p>It comes amid traffic jams near the summit as record numbers make the ascent, despite calls to limit the number of climbing permits.</p>


<p>Nepal has issued 381 permits at $11,000 (Â£8,600) each for the spring climbing season at the world's highest peak. </p>


<p>Two Indian climbers - Kalpana Das, 52, and Nihal Bagwan, 27 - died while scaling back down the mountain on Thursday. </p>

<p>Local tour organiser Keshav Paudel told AFP news agency that Bagwan had been "stuck in the traffic for more than 12 hours and was exhausted".</p>


<p>A 65-year-old Austrian climber died on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. </p>


<p>An Indian and an American lost their lives on the mountain on Wednesday, while an Irish professor, SÃ©amus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on 16 May. </p>


<p>Conditions this year have also been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. </p>


<p>Five people are known to have died on Everest and one in Lhotse in the spring season last year.</p>


<p>The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit.</p>


<p>The rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited.</p>


<p>Ben Fogle, the adventurer and television presenter who climbed the mountain last year, called for "London Marathon style lottery for climbing permits" in a Twitter post.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood, an abortion and healthcare provider, have sued Alabama over its ban on abortion.</p>


<p>The groups called the "extreme" law a "manmade public health emergency".</p>


<p>The ban, which offers no exceptions for rape or incest, was signed last week but has not taken effect.</p>


<p>Anti-abortion supporters expected legal challenges, and hope the appeals will reach the US Supreme Court and allow them to re-visit federal laws.</p>


<p>Randall Marshall, executive director of the Alabama ACLU, said: "Abortion remains - and will remain - safe and legal in Alabama. With this lawsuit, we are seeking a court order to make sure this law never takes effect."</p>

<p>The southern state's controversial abortion law has made national headlines for weeks. </p>


<p>Under Alabama's new ban, physicians who provide abortions could go to jail for up to 99 years, but a woman seeking the procedure would not be criminally liable. </p>


<p>The law allows exceptions only if the mother's life is seriously at risk or the foetus has a fatal complication.</p>

</ul>


<p>Alabama is one of several states to pass highly restrictive abortion laws this year - and dozens more have proposed similar bills in their legislatures.</p>


<p>On Friday, Missouri's governor signed into law a bill banning abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>


<p>The governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio - signed bills in recent months <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47940659" class="story-body__link">banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected</a>. </p>


<p>Currently, abortion is still allowed in the US thanks to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade, which ruled that abortions are protected up until viability - the point at which a foetus is able to survive outside the womb, around the third trimester of a pregnancy.</p>

<p>These types of anti-abortion laws have been deemed unconstitutional in the past, but supporters are emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member Supreme Court a conservative majority.</p>


<p>As the Alabama bill's sponsor, state congresswoman Terri Collins <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/restrictive-abortion-law-weighs-on-alabama-republicans-who-struggle-with-lack-of-exceptions-for-rape-incest/2019/05/13/bec7b736-759e-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html?utm_term=.35a0d15d63e2" class="story-body__link-external">explained to the Washington Post</a>: "What I'm trying to do here is get this case in front of the Supreme Court so Roe v Wade can be overturned." </p>


<p>The top court earlier this year blocked abortion restrictions in Louisiana - but only by a narrow margin, and that case is slated for a review later this year.</p>

<p>And the issue remains divisive nationwide - a 2018 Gallup poll found 48% of US women identified as pro-choice and 47% as anti-abortion.</p>


<p>One of the plaintiffs in the complaint, Dr Yashica Robinson, said Alabama women "already have to overcome so much just to get to our doors and this law further shames them, punishes providers like myself and stigmatises essential healthcare".</p>


<p>The ACLU and Planned Parenthood statement notes that they have "never lost a challenge to an abortion restriction in Alabama".</p>


<p>Similar abortion restrictions have already been blocked by legal challenges in Kentucky. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are also filing challenges in Ohio and Georgia.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The SpaceX company has begun the roll-out of its orbiting broadband system.</p>


<p>A Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida late on Thursday, packed with 60 satellites capable of giving users on the ground high-speed connections to the internet.</p>


<p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk's firm aims eventually to loft nearly 12,000 spacecraft for its "Starlink" network.</p>


<p>SpaceX is one of several commercial outfits with permission to fly an internet mega-constellation.</p>


<p>Others include the UK-based start-up OneWeb, which began its roll-out in February with six operational spacecraft.</p>

<p>Online retailer Amazon also has ambitions in this market. It's working on a 3,200-satellite proposal known as Project Kuiper. </p>


<p>All the concepts envisage flying spacecraft in a low-Earth orbit less than 2,000km above the planet. This will minimise the delay, or latency, in the internet connections.</p>

<p>Each satellite weighs 227kg, has multiple high-throughput antennas and a single solar array, the SpaceX CEO explained in a briefing last week.</p>


<p>The platforms are also equipped with electric propulsion - a system that expels electrically charged atoms of krypton to provide thrust. </p>


<p>The engine is needed to lift a Starlink from its drop-off altitude of 440km to its operational height of 550km. </p>


<p>The propulsion system will also act to maintain the satellite's correct position in the sky, and to bring it down at the end of its service life.</p>


<p>Mr Musk said the newly launched Starlinks were an iterative design and later platforms would have a higher specification, featuring for example inter-satellite links.</p>


<p>It was "one of the hardest engineering projects I've ever seen done," he said, and cautioned that much could go wrong in the early phases of the roll-out.</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Is there room up there for all these satellites?</h2>


<p>There is increasing unease about the number of satellites that could be launched in the next few years - for many purposes, not just broadband delivery - and how this might potentially clog up the space environment. </p>


<p>To give context to what is about to happen - there are just 2,000 operational satellites in orbit today, <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database" class="story-body__link-external">according to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a>' database. SpaceX's ambitions alone, if fully realised, would dwarf this population. </p>


<p>The great fear is that congested orbital highways will result in collisions and the production of debris that then initiates further destructive encounters.</p>


<p>SpaceX said it intended to be a responsible actor and had given its satellites the ability themselves to track orbital debris and to autonomously avoid it. </p>


<p>What is more, it added, all the Starlinks were 95% constructed from components that would burn up rapidly on re-entry to the atmosphere when decommissioned - exceeding all current safety standards.</p>


<p>It will be some time before SpaceX can actually offer connections to the internet. </p>


<p>For that it must launch many more than the 60 spacecraft on Thursday's Falcon. </p>


<p>Six further rocket flights will have to take place before minor broadband coverage is achieved. A dozen launches are required for moderate coverage, says Mr Musk.</p>


<p>He hopes ultimately that revenue from the telecommunications network can fund some of his other ideas: "We think this is a key stepping stone on the way towards establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the Moon."</p>

<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Lance Armstrong says he "wouldn't change a thing" about the doping that helped him win and then subsequently saw him stripped of seven Tour de France titles between 1999-2005.</p>


<p>The American was banned from cycling for life in 2012 before admitting to using performance-enhancing drugs.</p>


<p>But the 47-year-old <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/05/23/lance-armstrong-next-stage/">told NBC Sports<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> he had "learned a lot" from his "mistakes".</p>

    <div class="bbccom_advert">
        
    </div>
</div>


<p>"I don't learn all the lessons if I don't act that way," he added. </p>


<p>"We did what we had to do to win," Armstrong continued. "It wasn't legal, but I wouldn't change a thing - whether it's losing a bunch of money, or going from hero to zero."</p>


<p>Armstrong repeatedly denied doping allegations following his return from cancer until finally confessing during a television interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013.</p>


<p>In 2018, he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/43832785">agreed to pay</a> $5m (Â£3.5m) to the US government to settle a long-running lawsuit that could have cost him $100m (Â£71m) in damages.</p>


<p>He was accused of fraud by cheating while riding for the publicly funded US Postal Service team.</p>


<p>"It was a mistake, it led to a lot of other mistakes. It led to the most colossal meltdown in the history of sport. But I learned a lot," he said in a 30-minute interview with the <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/05/23/lance-armstrong-next-stage-mike-tirico-interview/">American network NBCSN<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> that will be broadcast next Wednesday.</p>


<p>"I wouldn't change the way I acted. I mean I would, but this is a longer answer.</p>


<p>"Primarily, I wouldn't change the lessons that I've learned. I don't learn all the lessons if I don't act that way. </p>


<p>"I don't get investigated and sanctioned if I don't act the way I acted. If I just doped and didn't say a thing, none of that would have happened. None of it. I was begging for, I was asking for them to come after me. It was an easy target."</p>


<p>Armstrong reiterated that he knew doping was widespread in cycling at that time.</p>


<p>He added: "I knew there were going to be knives at this fight. Not just fists. I knew there would be knives.</p>


<p>"I had knives, and then one day, people start showing up with guns. That's when you say, do I either fly back to Plano, Texas, and not know what you're going to do? Or do you walk to the gun store? I walked to the gun store. I didn't want to go home.</p>


<p>"I don't want to make excuses for myself that everybody did it or we never could have won without it. Those are all true, but the buck stops with me. I'm the one who made the decision to do what I did. I didn't want to go home, man. I was going to stay."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A French judge has charged the president of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) football club, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, with corruption over Qatari bids to host the world athletics championships.</p>


<p>Judicial sources quoted by AFP news agency said the case focused on the championships held in 2017 and 2019.</p>


<p>Mr Khelaifi, who is also the boss of Qatari TV channel BeIn Sports, has been under investigation since March.</p>


<p>Two payments totalling $3.5m (Â£2.8m), made in 2011, are under scrutiny.</p>


<p>London won the bidding to host the championships in 2017, but Qatar is hosting this year's championships in September-October.</p>

    <div class="bbccom_advert">
        
    </div>
</div>


<p>It is alleged that the payments were made by Oryx Qatar Sports Investment to another firm run by the son of Lamine Diack, ex-president of the IAAF, the world athletics governing body.</p>


<p>French prosecutors allege Mr Khelaifi approved the payment, but his lawyers deny he was either a director or a shareholder at the time in 2011. They say he only had shares in the company between 2013 and 2016.</p>


<p>Lamine Diack, 85, was charged with corruption in March in relation to the case, while an arrest warrant has been issued for his Senegal-based son, Papa Massata Diack. Lamine Diack was IAAF chief in 1999-2015.</p>

</ul>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Allegations denied</h2>


<p>The French term "mis en examen" - meaning "charged" in English - does not automatically trigger a trial, but means that prosecutors strongly suspect wrongdoing.</p>


<p>In a statement Mr Khelaifi's lawyers said the allegations were "inaccurate" and that he "had not validated any payment of any kind whatsoever" in relation to the allegations.</p>


<p>Another BeIn Sports executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, is also under investigation in France over the awarding of the 2017 championships. He is a PSG board member.</p>


<p>Mr Obaidly, quoted by his lawyer, called the allegations "utterly baseless and unsubstantiated" and said he would contest them.</p>


<p>In January, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47065393" class="story-body__link">Mr Khelaifi was elected to the executive committee of European football's governing body Uefa</a>. Uefa told the BBC it is "monitoring the situation".</p>


<p>In a statement, the IAAF said: "We continue to be available to the French prosecutor to share any information that may assist the investigation.</p>


<p>"However, we have not seen the specific indictments referred to by the media. The dates published in the media appear to coincide with the bidding timetable for the 2017 IAAF World Championships which were awarded to London.</p>


<p>"The 2019 World Championships bid process began in February 2014 with a decision in November 2014. Our rights holder for the region was, and still is, Abu Dhabi Media, who signed as a partner in January 2014."</p>


<p>A lawyer for Mr Khelaifi denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying the Oryx payments were fully transparent.</p>


<p>"Nasser Al-Khelaifi was neither a shareholder, nor a director of Oryx in 2011. He did not intervene either directly or indirectly in the candidature of Doha," he said.</p>


<p>PSG won the French Ligue 1 championship this season, but were knocked out of the Champions League by Manchester United.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Patients who have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain can safely take aspirin to cut their risk of future strokes and heart problems, according to a new study. </p>


<p>Aspirin thins the blood and so doctors have been cautious about giving it, fearing it could make bleeds worse. </p>


<p>But <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30840-2" class="story-body__link-external">The Lancet</a> research suggests it does not increase the risk of new brain bleeds, and may even lower it. </p>


<p>Experts say the "strong indication" needs confirming with more research.</p>


<p>Only take daily aspirin if your doctor recommends it, they advise.</p>


<div id="bbccom_mpu_1_2_3" class="bbccom_slot mpu-ad" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="bbccom_advert">

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Aspirin benefits and risks</h2>


<p>Aspirin is best known as a painkiller and is sometimes also taken to help bring down a fever. </p>


<p>But daily low-dose (75mg) aspirin is used to make the blood less sticky and can help to prevent heart attacks and stroke.</p>


<p>Most strokes are caused by clots in the blood vessels of the brain but some are caused by bleeds.</p>


<p>Because aspirin thins the blood, it can sometimes make the patient bleed more easily.</p>


<p>And aspirin isn't safe for everyone. </p>


<p>It can also cause indigestion and, more rarely, lead to stomach ulcers. </p>


<p>Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16 (unless their doctor prescribes it). </p>


<p>It can make children more likely to develop a very rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome (which can cause liver and brain damage).</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">The study</h2>


<p>The research involved 537 people from across the UK who had had a brain bleed while taking anti-platelet medicines, to stop blood clotting, including aspirin, dipyridamole or another drug called clopidogrel. </p>


<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item">Half of the patients were chosen at random to continue on their medicine (following a short pause immediately after their brain bleed), while the other half were told to stop taking it </li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">Over the five years of the study, 12 of those who kept taking the tablets suffered a brain bleed, compared with 23 of those who stopped</li>
</ul>


<p>The work is being presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference in Milan.</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What do experts say?</h2>


<p>The research cannot prove that aspirin prevents future strokes but it appears to be linked to a lower risk. </p>


<p>Nor does it suggest that aspirin is always safe to take. </p>


<p>But it hints that more patients - those with haemorrhagic or brain bleed strokes - might benefit from daily treatment.</p>


<p>It's not clear if the study findings will apply to all patients in real life. </p>


<p>Lead researcher, Prof Rutsam Salman, from the University of Edinburgh, said: "At the moment, people do not know what the right thing to do is. </p>


<p>"Doctors are hesitant about giving aspirin or aspirin-like drugs to people who have had this type of stroke. </p>


<p>"UK and European guidelines do not give any recommendation, because there hasn't been enough evidence.</p>


<p>"I think we have now confirmed safety with these findings.</p>


<p>"It certainly seems that aspirin is safe enough to give."</p>


<p>Prof Salman recommended more work to see if aspirin might actually lower the risk of brain bleeds as well as clots. </p>


<p>Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: "Around a third of people who suffer a brain haemorrhage, also known as haemorrhagic stroke, do so when they are taking an anti-platelet medicine, such as aspirin, to reduce the risk of a heart attack or an ischaemic [blood clot] stroke. </p>


<p>"We now have a strong indication they can carry on taking these potentially life-saving medicines after the brain haemorrhage without increasing the risk of another one, which is crucial new information for both patients and doctors."</p>


<p>Anyone with concerns should speak to a doctor before considering changing medication, however. </p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A sizeable oil slick developed in waters where tankers were damaged off the United Arab Emirates on 12 May.</p>


<p>Finnish company Iceye says one of its radar satellites detected a long trail leading from the Saudi-flagged vessel Amjad two days later.</p>


<p>The crude oil tanker and three other ships suffered damage while anchored outside the port of Fujairah.  </p>


<p>No-one has yet said they were behind the incidents. Nor is it clear precisely what happened.</p>


<p>US investigators reportedly believe <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48264499" class="story-body__link">Iran or groups it supports used explosives to damage the ships</a> - but no evidence has emerged to show that Iran was involved. </p>

<p>The analysis cannot state how much oil was present on the water, but the interpretation has been validated by Kongsberg Satellite Services, a Norwegian company with expertise in oil slick detection.</p>


<p>"Oil on top of seawater is visible on radar satellite imaging because it changes the way the water surface reflects radio waves," explained Iceye CEO Rafal Modrzewski.</p>


<p>"Oil forms a layer on top of the seawater. This changes the water's viscosity, flattening and making the surface smoother. As a result, oil on water appears on the image as a dark patch," he told BBC News.</p>


<p>The Amjad was reported to be empty of crude so the leak could well be engine fuel.</p>

<p>UAE and Saudi authorities have released few details about what happened on 12 May and an inquiry is under way.</p>


<p>The Reuters news agency reported that damage was inflicted on the Amjad; another Saudi tanker, Al Marzoqah; a UAE-flagged bunker vessel, A Michel; and a Norwegian tanker, Andrea Victory.</p>


<p>The event occurred amid rising tensions in the region.</p>


<p>Fujairah port is located on the east coast of the UAE in the Gulf of Oman and is at the funnel point into the Strait of Hormuz - the main shipping route linking Middle East oil producers with the rest of the world. </p>


<p>At any one time, many tens of ships will be anchored a few nautical miles from the port, either waiting to enter the Strait or stopping off before departing to destinations in Asia, Europe, the Americas and beyond.</p>

<p>Iceye released the X2 image on Thursday as a demonstration of its spacecraft's capability. The start-up's satellite design is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce than traditional radar spacecraft.</p>


<p>Iceye already has two suitcase-sized satellites in orbit and plans a large constellation to obtain rapid, repeat imagery of the Earth.</p>


<p>Radar's great advantage is that it sees the surface of the planet under all circumstances,  during the day or night and in all weathers. Radar satellites can therefore see and sense things that will often be invisible to other Earth observers, such as imagers that view the planet at wavelengths of light similar to our eyes.</p>


<p>"Iceye is launching (another) five satellites in 2019. Naturally, the exact timelines can always change depending on launch providers. New satellites are planned to be up in orbit already within a few months," Mr Modrzewski said. </p>


<p>Both the Fujairah emirate government and the ship owner have been asked for comment.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A school head embroiled in a row with parents over LGBT issues has vowed to "never stop" teaching pupils about equality.</p>


<p>Hundreds of protesters have gathered once more outside Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham as demonstrations reached their eighth week. </p>


<p>Pupils were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-48382358" class="story-body__link">sent home early</a> before the biggest crowd yet arrived at the gates.</p>


<p>The protests' organiser, Shakeel Afsar, said action would continue after next week's half-term break.</p>


<p>Those against the inclusion of LGBT issues in classes have said the content contradicts their Islamic beliefs, and have accused the school of not listening to parents' concerns.</p>

<p>Head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson described the protests as "horrific" and said that learning about equality was "crucial".</p>


<p>"That's not my opinion, that is the law," she said.</p>


<p>"That is the thin end of a very sinister wedge and our country will fall apart if that happens." </p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Sour and sinister'</h2>


<p>Mrs Hewitt-Clarkson said she felt "real despair" over the demonstrations that have been held outside her school for two months.</p>


<p>"It's not peaceful, it's aggressive, it's rude, it shouts accusations at me, at the governors. </p>


<p>"They use a megaphone - this is a cul-de-sac, there's no traffic noise to get over. It's really unpleasant, it's really aggressive, it's sour and it's sinister."</p>

<p>She also condemned Birmingham Hall Green MP Roger Godsiff, who agreed with protesters that five was too young for children to hear about LGBT issues.</p>


<p>"It's the fabric of British society is at stake here, because the equality laws hold us together," she said.</p>


<p>"The law is there as a mark in the sand that we all have to promote, and understand and aspire to."</p>


<p>She said the action was bringing "hatred and division to a beautiful primary school's pavement".</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Our children, our choice'</h2>


<p>The row over the inclusion of LGBT and transgender issues at primary schools in Birmingham began earlier this year. </p>


<p>Protests started outside Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock before spreading to Anderton.</p>


<ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/uk-england-48351401" class="story-body__link">The LGBT teaching row explained</a></li></ul>


<p>Friday's protest is thought to be the largest yet, with those from the local Muslim community as well as LGBT campaigners arriving to have their say.</p>


<p>Outside the school, protesters chanted "our children, our choice", "let kids be kids", and "head teacher, step down". Parents waved banners, including one that said "don't class us as homophobic".</p>


<p>Parents complained books that demonstrated homosexual relationships should not be shown to children as young as five.</p>


<p>Ansar Ashraf, who has three children at the school aged between five and nine, said the school was not listening to parents' concerns. </p>


<p>"We are protesting for them to hear us, that we have a right about what should be taught," he said.</p>


<p>"We are not homophobic or discriminating in any way, we just think there should be an age category."</p>

<p>Businessman Zafar Majid said: "The issue we have is the education being given, the indoctrination of the young children... they are expected to affirm, to celebrate, to embrace LGBT ideology, which is against the moral ethics of the many Abrahamic religions and faiths.</p>


<p>"We can co-exist, live peacefully together, but what we cannot do is force each other's ideology on one another."</p>


<p>Nazakat Hussein collected his children from school on Friday and said he felt the situation was getting "out of hand".</p>


<p>"It shouldn't be like this," he said. "The kids are getting scared. They are losing out on precious studying time here."</p>

<p>"I'm a queer Muslim campaigner and I'm very worried about the homophobia," he said.</p>


<p>"Muslims are not compelled to be homophobic and they are being homophobic - they don't get to define who is homophobic or not because they are not members of the LGBT community."</p>


<p>Olivia Everett, who lives nearby, said she was "frustrated" by the protests.</p>


<p>"Why do it outside a school where people are coming to get an education?" she said.</p>


<p>"I just think 'when is it going to stop?' because it's been weeks now and there's no resolution. </p>


<p>"I'm so over this, having to listen to homophobia every day. You can say it's not homophobic but it is.</p>


<p>"This is not what Birmingham is about, Birmingham is about multicultural values, accepting people. Think of the children having to go through this every day."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A nine-year-old boy has died after becoming trapped underneath a locker at a school in Essex.</p>


<p>It happened at an after-school swimming club at Great Baddow High School in Chelmsford on Thursday evening.</p>


<p>Leo Latifi, who was not a pupil at the school, was taken to hospital where he later died.</p>


<p>The head teacher of St Michael's Primary School paid tribute to her Year 4 pupil, who she said was a "sparkle in our school".</p>


<p>Essex Police said Leo was with family members when he fell from a locker and got trapped.</p>

<p>Maria Rumsey, head teacher at St Michael's, said staff, parents, governors and pupils were "shocked and immensely saddened" by Leo's death.</p>


<p>She said: "He will be greatly missed by all. We wish to extend our thoughts and condolences to all of Leo's family and friends at this saddest of times. </p>


<p>"Leo was a sparkle in our school. His face lit up the classroom and his mischievous blue eyes made us all smile.  </p>


<p>"He was an avid scientist, who only on Wednesday was in his element hunting for bugs on the school field. </p>


<p>"Leo was always keen to share his model-building and wowed the class when he brought in the finished masterpieces. He had a wide circle of friends in the year group, all of whom will miss him greatly."</p>


<p>She added the school would be supporting staff and pupils as they came to terms with the loss.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Thirty people taking part in a yoga session have been arrested during a private class in Iran, reports suggest, causing a buzz across the country's social media.</p>


<p>They were detained at a private residence in the northern city of Gorgan, where they were apparently taking part in a mixed class.</p>


<p>Local justice department official Massoud Soleimani said the instructor, who was also arrested, had no licence to run the class and had advertised the event on Instagram. </p>


<p>He also said that those taking part were wearing "inappropriate outfits" and had "behaved inappropriately", <a href="https://bit.ly/30Hu73K" class="story-body__link-external">the Tasnim news agency reports</a>.</p>


<p>The Islamic establishment in Iran does not allow any mixed-gender sports activities. </p>


<p>Professional-level yoga teaching is also banned in the country. </p>


<p>Mr Soleimani, the deputy chief of the Islamic Revolution Court in Gorgan which is the capital of Golestan Province, did not give any more details about the attire or behaviour of the detained group.</p>


<p>He did say that security forces had been monitoring the residence for some time before making the arrests.</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Cancelled classes</h2>


<p>The story, which was <a href="https://bit.ly/2EvZ814" class="story-body__link-external">also reported by the Young Journalists Club,</a> has caused a stir online and has become a top trending topic in social discussions.</p>


<p>"They [Iranian authorities] think even the word yoga is problematic based on the Sharia," one user tweeted. </p>


<p>"An establishment that finds even yoga harmful does not need the USS Abraham Lincoln warship to end its existence," another tweeter added, referring to the recent deployment of US warships to the region. </p>


<p>Others say they have cancelled their plans to sign up to yoga classes following the arrests in Gorgan.        </p>


<p>"I guess the authorities need to tell us what exactly we are allowed to do in this country," commented another tweeter.</p>


<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-40245830" class="story-body__link">Iranian sports authorities issued a ban on Colombian dance aerobics exercise zumba</a> and "any harmonious movement or body-shaking instruction".</p>


<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-middle-east-40880420" class="story-body__link">Iran arrests six for zumba dancing </a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-middle-east-44777677" class="story-body__link">'I risked everything to dance in Iran'</a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36101150" class="story-body__link">Who are Islamic 'morality police'?</a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/blogs-trending-42612546" class="story-body__link">How do Iranians defy the internet censors?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Back then Iran's Sport for All Federation penned a letter to Iran's Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to ban activities, including zumba, for contravening "Islamic ideology".</p>


<p>While there have have been public gatherings of yoga fans in the country over the past few years, "underground" and "unIslamic" classes, which are promoted across social media, are frowned upon.</p>


<p>While revealing the arrests, Mr Soleimani also criticised the "lack of surveillance of activities" on social media in the country.</p>


<p>Twitter is officially banned in the country. However, there does appear to be an increased surveillance of Instagram by Iran's authorities, especially more recently.</p>


<p>This week the social media accounts of at least three street musicians were apparently seized by Iranian authorities for publishing "criminal content", <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-48366149" class="story-body__link">while singer Negar Moazzam is currently under investigation</a> after performing for a group of tourists in the country's Isfahan Province. </p>


<p>Her Instagram account is no longer public.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has apologised after a teacher alleged her group of pupils suffered racist language and treatment during a visit. </p>


<p>Marvelyne Lamy said staff had followed the black and other minority 12 and 13-year-olds, yelling at them not to touch exhibits while ignoring white groups.</p>


<p>She said staff told the group: "No food, no drink, and no watermelon."</p>


<p>The term dates back to the US civil war and is considered derogatory when used in relation to the black community.</p>


<p>Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said the comments made by staff were <a href="https://twitter.com/marty_walsh/status/1131639647443083265" class="story-body__link-external">"incredibly disturbing".</a></p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What happened during the trip?</h2>


<p>Ms Lamy, an English teacher at the Davis Leadership Academy in Boston, complained about the "racial profiling" of her class of black and minority pupils in a Facebook post. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marvelyne.lamy/posts/10158516060369676?__tn__=-R" class="story-body__link-external">It has been shared more than 1,000 times</a>.</p>


<p>"We were instructed not to touch any of the artefacts in the museum, yet the white students there touched the displays several times while security looked on without saying anything," she said. </p>


<p>"The minute one of our students followed suit, the security guards would yell at them that they should not touch exhibits."</p>


<p>Her students became agitated because of this treatment and she gathered them to leave as a result, she said.</p>


<p>Visitors at the museum also made racist and derogatory remarks about the pupils, Ms Lamy said.</p>


<p>"The worse part about all of this is seeing the hurt look on my children's faces as this was their first time experiencing racism first hand," she said. </p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How has the museum responded?</h2>


<p>In an open letter, <a href="https://www.mfa.org/about/open-letter-from-mfa-leadership-team?fbclid=IwAR1ex4Xot2UPW439CrlQ_0s4DlkegNm83It74MhihnmH010JMOkzhcGAmOg" class="story-body__link-external">the museum apologised</a> and said Ms Lamy and her pupils had "encountered a range of challenging and unacceptable experiences that made them feel unwelcome".</p>


<p>The museum said it was investigating the incident and was "committed to being a place where all people trust that they will feel safe and treated with respect", they said.</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Why is 'watermelon' a racist term in the US?</h2>


<p>When slavery was abolished at the end of the 1860s some black people grew and sold watermelon to provide for their families.</p>


<p>The fruit went on to be used as an excuse to characterise an entire section of the population as being lazy and content with simple pleasures and, therefore, flaunting their independence. </p>


<p>Minstrel shows, caricatures, songs and cartoons were used to used to dehumanise and denigrate the black community. </p>


<p>In 2014 <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/01/boston-herald-apologizes-for-obama-watermelon-toothpaste-cartoon/" class="story-body__link-external">The Boston Herald was forced to apologise</a> for a cartoon after an intruder broke into the White House during Barack Obama's presidency. The cartoon showed a man sitting in the bathtub referring to "watermelon flavoured toothpaste".</p>


<p>In another separate incident in 2014 <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/22/us/coach-fired-watermelon-ritual-irpt/" class="story-body__link-external">an American football coach in South Carolina was first fired and then re-instated</a> for allowing players to smash a watermelon while making ape-like noises in a post game celebration.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The chief executive of Thames Water has stepped down after failing to turn around the performance of one of the UK's largest utility companies.</p>


<p>Steve Robertson will be replaced with immediate effect.</p>


<p>A source close to the company said the firm wanted someone with "a mind for operations".</p>


<p>Thames Water, which manages water supplies and waste water, has struggled with leaks, falling profits and increasing customer complaints.</p>


<p>The firm said that Mr Robertson, who was appointed chief executive in September 2016, had "successfully transformed" the firm "in a challenging environment" but that he was leaving by mutual agreement.</p>

<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/business-47918253" class="story-body__link">Water firm outlines 'nationalisation refund'</a></li>
</ul>


<p>But Thames Water has been criticised for not being able to bring the number of leaks under control. </p>


<p>In December the firm said last spring's cold weather had caused pipes to burst, while the summer heatwave had brought supply problems. </p>


<p>Since 2017, Thames Water has been fined more than Â£128m for poor management of leaks.</p>


<p>In September, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-45395914" class="story-body__link">it announced fresh investment in infrastructure</a> as part of a Â£11.7bn five-year plan.</p>


<p>Thames Water said under Mr Robertson's tenure it had "increased its focus on customer satisfaction, improved incident response capabilities, expanded support for vulnerable families and invested more than Â£2bn in the network to improve overall performance".</p>

<p>Ian Marchant, interim executive chairman, who will lead the company while a permanent replacement is found said: "We need to continue to ensure that Thames Water is an organisation that both customers and staff feel proud of."</p>


<p>The future of the water industry has recently become a hot political issue, with Labour saying it would take it back into public ownership if elected.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The first black female director in competition at the Cannes Film Festival has said she was inspired by her "need to see black people on screen".</p>


<p>French-Senegalese star Mati Diop made history on Thursday when Atlantics became the first film made by a woman of African descent to be screened in the event's 72 year history.</p>


<p>Diop revealed she was "moved" but also "a little sad" at the achievement.</p>


<p>"It's pretty late and it's incredible that it is still relevant," she said.</p>


<p>"My first feeling to be the first black female director was a little sadness that this only happened today in 2019.</p>

<p>"I knew it as I obviously don't know any black women who came here before. I knew it but it's always a reminder that so much work needs to be done still."</p>

<p>"It's why I needed to make this film, I needed to see black people on screen - it was an urgent need."</p>

<p>Actor Ibrahima Mbaye, who plays a troubled local detective, joked that he thought the film would only reach as far as Senegalese TV. </p>


<p>Diop hopes her historic feat will afford more black women the opportunity to bring their stories to the silver screen.</p>


<p>"When you feel your own little story meets the bigger story the feeling is that it doesn't belong to you, which is quite moving really.</p>


<p>"I'm a bit sceptical towards 'proudness' towards identity.</p>


<p>"But if for some young black female film directors I can represent a new dynamic, I'm obviously extremely happy."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">US President Donald Trump has ordered US intelligence agencies to co-operate with an investigation into whether he was spied on during the 2016 election.</p>


<p>The probe, headed by Attorney General William Barr, is examining the origins of the Russia investigation.</p>


<p>It has long been requested by Mr Trump, who often labels the inquiry into Russian interference a "witch hunt".</p>


<p>On Thursday he announced a directive that gave Mr Barr sweeping new powers, including to declassify documents.</p>


<p>Mr Barr is already subject to intense scrutiny and criticism by Democrats - who have accused him of acting on the president's behalf and not in the national interest.</p>

<p>In April, the attorney general told Congress that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign, and said he wanted to ensure that any intelligence-gathering had been legitimate. </p>


<p>Earlier this month, Mr Barr assigned a federal prosecutor to look at the origins of the Russia investigation. Mr Trump has denied asking Mr Barr to do so.</p>


<p>Thursday's memorandum directs the heads of intelligence agencies to "promptly provide" information to Mr Barr upon his request.</p>


<p>"Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions," press secretary Sarah Sanders said.</p>


<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What did the Russia investigation find?</h2>


<p>After almost two years, a redacted version of the report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller was released in April.</p>


<p>The report concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election "in sweeping and systematic fashion" but did not find there had been a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign.</p>


<p>It did, however, detail 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation.</p>


<p>After the report was released, Mr Barr was accused of mischaracterising its findings in a previously released summary. </p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">An open question</h2>


<p><strong>Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter, BBC News</strong></p>


<p>Now comes the counter-attack</p>


<p>For nearly two years, Donald Trump was buffeted by an investigation into his presidential campaign conducted from within his own justice department. Now that the Robert Mueller inquiry has concluded, the administration's investigatory powers - heralded by the attorney general - are being directed at those who began the investigation.</p>


<p>The president has long railed against the Russia inquiry as an illegitimate hoax designed to "spy" on him and his associates. On Thursday he stood by his accusation that senior intelligence agency officials involved in the investigation had committed "treason" - even after being reminded by a reporter that the punishment for treason is death.</p>


<p>Just what, if anything, Attorney General Barr will unearth with his newly granted powers to request and declassify intelligence agency documents is an open question. He speculated during recent congressional hearings that what the public knows about government surveillance of members of the Trump 2016 campaign team may not be the whole story.</p>


<p>At the very least, however, the president can now claim that he has turned the tables on his long-time antagonists. His supporters will be thrilled. Democrats will call it a distraction. And the political battles rage on.</p>

<p>"The cover-up has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American," he added.</p>

<p>He and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi traded barbs on Thursday about each other's mental stability after Mr Trump abruptly cut short a meeting earlier this week.</p>


<p>Mr Trump has announced the end of all bipartisan co-operation with the Democrats until they end all their investigations into him. </p>
