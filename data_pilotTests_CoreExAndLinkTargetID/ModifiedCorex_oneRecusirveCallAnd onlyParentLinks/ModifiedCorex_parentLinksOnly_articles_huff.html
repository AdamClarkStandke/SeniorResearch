<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="10" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>Robinson’s&nbsp;<em>New York 2140</em>, published last year,&nbsp;lays out a vision of what climate catastrophe and a leftist uprising against the capitalist forces that caused it would look like. So HuffPost asked him to elaborate on what he sees as the future of geoengineering. The following was edited for length and clarity.</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="11" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa question">
<p><strong>How do you define geoengineering and what are the forms it will most likely take?</strong></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="12" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>I guess the definition would be something like “a deliberate planned attempt by human beings to mitigate the damages of climate change, of carbon dioxide and methane buildup in the atmosphere, and of ecological damage generally, by way of some action that is large-scale” — if not global in reach, then regional in ways that might have global repercussions.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been saying that “geoengineering” is a bad name because engineering implies we know what we’re doing more than we really do. Also, that we have more powers than we actually have. I’ve suggested we think of it as “geo-finessing” or “geo-tweaking” or even “geo-begging,” to better indicate our relative ignorance and weakness in the face of global geochemical processes. Lots of those processes we can’t do anything about, even if we really want to. So the name needs some unpacking. </span></p>
<p><span>The most likely forms it might take, I think, are the following: casting dust-like particles into the atmosphere to mimic a volcanic eruption, so that for a number of years after that, the global average temperatures would go down a bit. Drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by way of biological and/or mechanical means. Pumping seawater onto the ice cap of Eastern Antarctica. Stimulating growth of small life forms in the ocean that would then die and take their carbon to the seafloor ― this has been mentioned as a possibility, but it’s widely regarded as potentially dangerous for ocean ecologies. Still, it might be tested on small scales, even used on small scales, which would reduce its power to help but also its power to harm.</span></p>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="13" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>Why do you think people, particularly on the left, are so concerned about geoengineering?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="14" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>Because we don’t know enough about it to be confident that anything we attempt in that way won’t cause even worse knock-on effects. It’s a legitimate concern, although it can be exaggerated. Casting particles into the atmosphere might harm the monsoon ― yes, that’s a real concern. But thinking it will cast us into an ice age is not paying attention to what [Mount] Pinatubo’s eruption did nor to the physics of the situation. </span></p>
<p><span>So it’s a question of paying close attention to the science we do have and then making judgments accordingly. As a leftist, I think there is a bad tendency among some leftists to conflate science with capitalism. They are not the same. I am against capitalism, I am for science. What we need is science guided by its own scientific methods when doing the science ― then guided by a leftist tilt toward justice and sustainability when it’s put to use. We need to choose to put science, technology, engineering and medicine to good human and biosphere work, rather than let it be bought to serve profit for the few most wealthy.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="15" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>OK, so give me the socialist utopian case for geoengineering.</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="16" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>If it’s done by international agreements, or even by single governments acting on their own, it would be a social action. Possibly a sign of desperation, but a socialized act. If it were done by some individuals deciding to act on their own, it would be an individual’s action. So it depends on how it happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Say global average temperatures rise so high that the heat waves become deadly. This could happen. If a heat wave kills a hundred million people in some country, and that country decides to imitate a Pinatubo-sized volcanic eruption artificially to cool temperatures for five years, it may not matter whether that government is left or right. They will defend themselves to the world, and I don’t know what the world could say or do at that point. It would be a case of desperate measures for a desperate time. </span></p>
<p><span>So this is getting into a very science fictional area, a kind of thought experiment that follows the trajectories of where we are going now. If we get to a bad enough state with the climate and Earth’s biosphere generally headed for a mass extinction event that will hammer humanity, the utopian aspect of it gets a little into the negative side, but it is still there ― which is to say, if we can get out of the 21st century without a mass extinction event, that’s looking pretty utopian right now! So get used to that, admit the trajectory we are on, and start thinking of all possible solutions, or rather mitigations, as being on the table for consideration.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="17" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>How do you make geoengineering equitable?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="18" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>If democratically elected representative governments were to agree with each other to do it, using existing treaty systems and the U.N., the Paris Accords, etc., and it kept millions of people (often the least culpable when it comes to fossil fuel burning) from dying, then I guess you could say it was equitable.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="19" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>What’s the worst-case scenario you can imagine?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="20" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>Mass extinctions of thousands of species, agricultural disruptions leading to food shortages, and resulting social-political chaos, including war; thus mass death for humans, by way of hunger, heat waves, war. Sea level rise flooding all the beaches of the world and all the seaports, thus disrupting fishing, agriculture, world trade, and so on. The worst-case scenario, entirely possible given the trajectory we are on now, is VERY BAD. No one alive today should be fooling themselves about this.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="21" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>And the best-case scenario?</strong></p></div>






<div id="inline-newsletter_placeholder"></div>


<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="22" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>The best-case scenario is also completely possible from our current situation, despite the trajectory we are on. It would be a just, sustainable world in which the energy flows in the biosphere were in balance, such that the extinction rates would be normal, ecosystems everywhere restored to health, and 10 billion humans ― shrinking quite naturally in number as all the women in the world began living in complete gender equality ― were all living with adequate food, water, shelter, clothing, health care, education, and work. </span></p>
<p><span>This best-case scenario, the utopian turn, is physically possible if it were the goal of human civilization and became what we were all working toward together. The crucial technologies involved are not so much physical as they are social, which is to say, we have to have ecologically guided economics and politics. It is by its very nature a leftist vision, in that it foregrounds justice and welfare for all.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="23" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>How has the way you write about geoengineering in your books changed over time?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="24" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>My Mars trilogy can be read as a big metaphor for geoengineering, as practiced on Mars and called terraforming. Many of the considerations, both technical and social, are much the same. It’s a way to think about the issues involved. </span></p>
<p><span>Then my <em>Antarctica</em> was about paleoclimate and what has happened on Earth in the past. </span></p>
<p>Then in <em>Green Earth</em>, I wrote about the Gulf Stream stalling, which is probably what happened in the Younger Dryas [period], when the global climate went from warm and wet to cold and dry in three years. That was a span of time a novel could handle, and people were speculating that the rapid melting of Greenland’s ice might stall the Gulf Stream again, causing another such radical quick change in global climate. Could we do anything about that? That novel, which first appeared in trilogy form beginning with <em>Forty Signs of Rain</em>, explored that scenario. It isn’t considered the likeliest scenario now, but again, the considerations are the same.</p>
<p>Then in <em>New York 2140,</em> I explored the ramifications of rapid sea level rise, a possibility that was pointed out in a paper by [climatologist] James Hansen, et al., when I was writing the book.</p>
<p><span>Those have been the major explorations in stories so far. I think I’ll have to try again with another scenario. No one can predict the future that will really come ― that’s impossible. But scenarios can be outlined as a kind of modeling exercise, to help us make decisions about what to do now to get to a future we want. It’s the story of the century so it makes sense to keep coming back to it.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="25" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>Does most science fiction help or harm the public perception of geoengineering?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="26" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>I don’t know. I’ve only read a small portion of contemporary science fiction, and geoengineering has seldom come into it. My impression is that some movies have portrayed geoengineering as a hubristic techno silver-bullet response that is sure to screw things up. It’s a version of the old “there are some things mankind is not meant to know,” blah blah. Also, to be fair, an extrapolation from certain hubristic power fantasies at earlier moments of history, like DDT in the streets, thalidomide, free nuclear power for all, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s a desperate enough idea to create doubts it can succeed, and it also suggests a kind of moral hazard, in that if we think we can tech our way out of a disaster, we won’t do the daily little things that are needed as part of the solution. So skepticism is in order, and no one, not even scientists calling for more research, is happy about the idea of geoengineering as such. So whether science fiction helps or harms public perception, I’m not sure. When I write my stories, I’m trying to clarify my own thoughts.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="27" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>Are you afraid for the future?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="28" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>Yes.</span></p>
</div></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="29" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><strong>What makes you most hopeful for a future in which humans who aren’t ultrarich can still thrive?</strong></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="30" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><div class="qa answer">
<p><span>Progressive taxation, progressive politics, the Paris Accords, the Endangered Species Act, leftists everywhere on Earth including China, environmentalists everywhere, the growing green-red coalition or united front of environmentalists and leftists, the creative power of STEM, the humanist traditions in philosophy, people’s concern for their children, the growing sense of a “global village” we are all part of, the urge to survive. These are some of the things that make me hopeful. Hope is stubborn. It exists in us at the cellular level and works up from there, as part of the urge to live. So hope will persist. The question is, can we put it to use?</span></p>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="7" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Prosecutors allege that in May 2017, Gallagher was accompanying Iraqi coalition partner forces during anti-Islamic State operations in northern Iraq. The Iraqi forces had captured a suspected militant who Navy SEALs estimated was between 15 and 22 years old, according to witness accounts. The suspected ISIS fighter was detained after a U.S. drone strike on a building, and a witness said he was awake and had sustained injuries that were not life-threatening. Members of the Navy SEAL platoon heard Gallagher say “Nobody touch him, he’s mine,” according to Navy Judge Capt. Aaron Rugh’s findings-of-fact statement, obtained by The San Diego Union-Tribune.</span>&nbsp;</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="8" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Gallagher allegedly approached the vehicle where the suspected ISIS fighter was held and brought him out onto the ground. Three Navy SEALs say they then witnessed Gallagher pull out a knife that he often carried and repeatedly stab the prisoner in the neck, killing him. During the next several days, Gallagher allegedly said he would kill anyone who blew the whistle on his actions, and demanded the names of any SEALs who disagreed with his conduct.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="9" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Prosecutors allege that Gallagher performed a reenlistment ceremony next to the person he killed, and took a photo of the body. They allege he sent the photo to a friend and texted: “Got him with my hunting knife.”</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="10" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>SEALs also claim that Gallagher repeatedly shot at and may have killed civilians. One incident involved Gallagher shooting an elderly man near a riverbank while on sniper duty, according to two SEAL witnesses. The man fell to the ground and appeared motionless. A witness also said they saw a young girl in a flower-print hijab walking along a path and suddenly clutching her stomach as though she’d been shot. Her companions looked up at a tower where Gallagher was in position and then carried the injured girl away. An officer in Gallagher’s chain of command is also prepared to testify that Gallagher called in false coordinates to target a mosque, according to </span><a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/02/10/legal-bombshells-explode-on-two-seal-war-crimes-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:10;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="9" data-v9y="0"><span>documents reviewed</span></a><span> by the Navy Times.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="11" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Gallagher has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. The investigation has become a major point of controversy, and Gallagher has received the support of conservatives such as Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), who claims to have viewed combat footage that exonerates Gallagher. The supposed footage has not been made public.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="12" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>There was another turn in the case last week, when Gallagher’s defense attorneys found that prosecutors embedded </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/seals-lawyer-says-navy-spied-on-defense-without-approval/2019/05/21/e4542d08-7c2f-11e9-b1f3-b233fe5811ef_story.html?utm_term=.04b68b5d67a2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:12;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="10" data-v9y="0"><span>tracking software</span></a><span> in their emails to Gallagher’s team and a journalist at the Navy Times. His court date has been delayed until a decision is reached on whether that action compromised Gallagher’s right to a fair trial ― although Trump’s pardon would make those deliberations redundant.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="13" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><h3><strong>Matthew Golsteyn</strong></h3></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="14" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Maj. Matthew Golsteyn, a former Green Beret, faces a premeditated murder charge for killing an unarmed man in Afghanistan who Golsteyn suspected of being a Taliban bombmaker. Golsteyn, like Gallagher, has conservatives calling for his release. Trump tweeted in December that Golsteyn is a “military hero.”</span></p></div>

Afghan forces detained a man afterward who allegedly had bomb-making materials on him, but Golsteyn </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/they-do-not-obey-their-own-rules-soldier-facing-murder-case-says-he-must-defend-himself-against-the-army/2019/02/09/a4cdb5b2-2baf-11e9-97b3-ae59fbae7960_story.html?utm_term=.306a2b5305b6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:15;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="0"><span>told The Washington Post</span></a><span> that U.S. troops were not allowed to hold any captives because of a lack of resources. The timeline of what happened next is contested and forms the focus of Golsteyn’s upcoming trial, but at some point after the suspected bombmaker’s release, Golsteyn recaptured the unarmed man and killed him.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="16" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Golsteyn admitted to killing the man during a 2011 job interview with the CIA, saying he shot the suspected bombmaker and burned his body. His admission to the CIA prompted an Army review that resulted in a formal reprimand and the rescinding of his Silver Star award, but no charges due to lack of evidence. Golsteyn also gave an interview to Fox News in 2016 where he admitted to killing the Afghan man, a </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/green-beret-says-he-was-charged-murder-because-fox-n948976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:16;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="0"><span>statement he blames</span></a><span> for attracting attention and resulting in his murder charge in 2018.

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="19" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>In the incident, Slatten and other Blackwater contractors were operating in Baghdad in September 2007 when they set up a blockade at a traffic stop outside the city’s Green Zone.

Two Iraqi police officers then approached the Kia, saw Al Rubia’y dead with a bullet hole in his forehead and waved at the Blackwater contractors to stop firing.</span></p></div>

But the stopped Kia began to roll forward, which Blackwater contractors later claimed they took as a sign it was a car bomb. The contractors opened fire, killing Al Rubia’y’s mother and 15 other civilians at the busy traffic stop. Wounded civilians fled as Blackwater guards fired at random. One witness later described a dead man’s body shaking on the ground as guards fired bullets into the corpse. There was no car bomb, and two children ages 9 and 11 were among the dead.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="21" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Slatten was twice convicted of murder for the killing of Al Rubia’y, first in 2014 and again in 2018 after a federal appeals court called for a new trial. Three Blackwater contractors were convicted of other charges, including manslaughter, for their roles in the massacre. </span></p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="3" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>In May 2016, water authorities discovered perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, a toxic chemical linked to cancer, thyroid problems and chronic kidney disease, in the water supply. The chemical came from firefighting foam that ran off into a nearby well. The town shut the contaminated well down within a week</span><span>. Within days of Castello-Janesh moving in, officials found PFOS in another well the city draws from and shut it down. In August, a third city well had to be shuttered. </span></p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="4" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The town began work installing a special carbon filtration system with a $720,000 grant from the state. But late last month, Castello-Janesh awoke to find black and brown sediment in her toilet. The water coming from her faucets was murky, too. While PFOS is an invisible, odorless chemical that clings to water molecules, this was something different. Another type of contamination had breached her filters. </span></p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="5" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Castello-Janesh panicked. She called the town. Water authorities assured her there was nothing to worry about ― that it was the result of too many people watering their lawns. With three wells offline, heavy use was taxing the already-diminished water supply. The woman on the phone compared the situation to a car with a drained gas tank, operating on fumes, and insisted there was nothing to worry about.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="6" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>“I mean, what the fuck. Are you kidding me?

Like other municipalities with water tainted by PFOS or similar chemicals, the town is small, sleepy and working-class. The state has doled out money for filtration systems, but many residents are concerned officials aren’t doing enough to clean up the contamination at the source, leaving them feeling abandoned and paranoid about the efficacy of filters. </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="8" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>But Hampton Bays stands out as a slow-burner, an infrastructure disaster that simmered to boil over two years. Officials acted quickly to shutter wells where PFOS levels exceeded a conservative federal health advisory. But critics say authorities failed to respond proactively, allowing the wells to remain in use even though mountain evidence suggests the federal limit is far too high. And they say local officials have neglected a dwindling water supply, allowing sediment to build up in pipes and spew into homes. </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="9" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The dark, silty residue is harmless, state officials say. ﻿Robert King, the town’s water superintendent, said it’s rust that naturally accumulates in pipes that was kicked up by unusually high demand on the district’s remaining active wells.&nbsp;</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="10" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>“The water was rushing through the pipes so fast because we didn’t have the three wells running,” King said. “It was actually causing turbulence.”&nbsp;</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="11" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>He said the water is safe and that most residents “have been very understanding” about the issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="12" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>But in a town already surprised three times by a spreading, toxic contamination, the black and brown dregs gushing from faucets and toilets are a terrifying menace, sending residents scrambling for bottled water.&nbsp;Some wonder if this problem would be handled differently if it were happening in one of Hampton Bays’ neighboring vacation enclaves for the ultrarich.</span></p></div>

For PFOS, the EPA pegged the figure at 200 parts per trillion. In 2013, EPA mandated that utilities serving 10,000 people or more should “periodically” sample for PFAS. In 2014, the Hampton Bays Water District first discovered PFOS, though at levels below the advisory threshold. </span></p></div>

<p>The plaintiffs told HuffPost they were humbled by the court’s verdict. For them, it was an opportunity to hold the government to account. “I think it opened the door for them to say we have made mistakes, and maybe it was the first step to be able to change,” Rozo says.</p>






<p><span>Walter Vergara, senior fellow at WRI, says Colombia’s deforestation situation is “worse than expected,” although he also says the government has taken some action to halt tree cover loss. It has </span><a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/03/colombia-scraps-amazon-highway-plans-due-to-deforestation-concerns/" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:29;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0"><span>canceled a major highway</span></a><span> that would have run through the rainforest, for example, and launched a “</span><a href="https://www.cgiar.org/news-events/news/new-colombia-green-belt-provides-protective-barrier-amazon-biome/" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:29;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="0"><span>green belt</span></a><span>” initiative to protect a 22.7 million-acre forest corridor ― a move Vergara describes as the most important forest conservation</span> <span>effort in Latin America in terms of scale.</span></p>






<p><span>Luz Marina Mantilla Cárdenas, director general of the Amazon Institute of Scientific Research, a governmental organization,</span> <span>says it’s not just companies that threaten Colombia’s environment, it’s normal people trying to support themselves and their families, for example by cutting down forests to produce timber for domestic use.</span></p>






<p>“For everyone’s benefit, it is important to include people after the conflict. They should be involved in decisions about the land that is relevant to them and where they live,” she says.</p>






<p>Alvear Daza agrees, although ultimately he doesn’t believe the government has the capacity to regulate what’s going on in these large spaces. Nor does he believe it cares.</p>






<p>“It’s a very worrying situation,” he says. “There’s no concern for the environment and the environmental effects of deforestation&nbsp;[...] Naturally people saw an opportunity to cultivate more farms, and therefore increase productivity. People are hungry, people need to work, people are going to take advantage.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="3" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>To put it in the words of a waste manager in Bakersfield, California, the situation is “not just a little bad, it is terrible.”</p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="4" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>“I’ve been in garbage all my life. This is unprecedented,” Kevin Barnes, the city’s solid waste director,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bakersfield.com/news/bakersfield-recycling-in-trouble-months-after-china-stops-taking-world/article_a8dce4d0-862c-11e8-8d39-dbb80a9d8c51.html" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:4;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="4" data-v9y="0">told The Bakersfield Californian</a>&nbsp;earlier this month. “I think there’s been nothing in history this severe for the markets. So we’re in uncharted waters here.”</p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="5" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>The first signs of trouble came in January when China,&nbsp;which had long served as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/china-recycling-waste-ban_n_5a684285e4b0dc592a0dd7b9" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:5;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="5" data-v9y="0">the world’s de facto wastebasket</a>, banned the importation of several categories of recyclable waste. For decades,&nbsp;China had bought massive shipments of recyclable plastics, paper, cardboard and other materials from countries around the world.</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="6" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>It had been a win-win situation. On the one hand, China needed a steady supply of recyclable waste to feed its flourishing manufacturing sector. And on the other, countries like the U.S., Canada, Germany, the U.K. and Japan lacked the recycling facilities and manpower that China had ― and they desperately needed a destination for their growing quantity of garbage.</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="7" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>About <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-07/20/c_136459809.htm" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:7;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="0">a year ago</a>, however, China abruptly announced its intention to close its borders to this trash influx.

It also demanded that other waste materials, like cardboard and scrap metal, have only 0.5 percent contamination from food and other sources ― a standard that American recyclers have said is “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amid-trade-feud-recycling-is-in-danger-of-landing-on-trash-pile-1523525401" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:7;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="0">impossible</a>” to meet.</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="8" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>The immediate global impact of the new Chinese restrictions,&nbsp;enforced on Jan. 1, was staggering. “It was a huge shock — a tsunami for the industry,”&nbsp;said Arnaud Brunet, head of the <a href="http://www.bir.org/" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:8;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="9" data-v9y="0">Bureau of International Recycling</a>, speaking from Brussels on Wednesday. “When the biggest market for recyclables progressively shuts the door to imports, you can expect the global industry will be under stress.”</p></div>

Between 1992 and 2016, China accepted more than 110 million tons of plastic scrap from countries around the globe, or about 45 percent of the world’s plastic waste. A <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat0131.full" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:9;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="0">recent study</a>&nbsp;predicts that about 120 million tons of plastic waste will be displaced worldwide by 2030 because of China’s policy change.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="31" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p class="p14">As the above Eater video explains, a single muscle stem cell can multiply into a trillion muscle cells in the right medium.

These fibers are then layered together to create a product like a hamburger patty, which Post said takes about 10,000 muscle fibers&nbsp;— and about 8 to 9 weeks — to create.</p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="32" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p class="p14">That production rate is pretty much fixed, said Post, as it’s based on the natural replication cycle of the stem cells. “You don’t want to mess with that,” he said.</p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="41" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p class="p14">All it’ll take is one “major breakthrough” in one part of the production process for a “game-changing” effect on the science, Kim added. “There are people out there who have the expertise [to make these breakthroughs happen], they just don’t have the funding right now to do it.”</p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="6" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>In some cases, hybrids breeding with hybrids can ultimately lead to the formation of distinct new species, but there’s no evidence that’s happening here, according to Baird.</p></div>

He suspects the one melon-headed whale traveling with the rough-toothed dolphin group is likely the hybrid’s mother and has been hanging out with the pod for a while, creating “a greater than normal likelihood of inter-species mating.”</p></div>

When a door slams shut, another famously opens full of opportunity. This may indeed be the case. The principles of a <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy" target="_blank" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:9;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="0">circular economy</a>, where plastic waste would be valued as a resource and continually recycled, have made serious inroads.

To the traditional mantra of the 3Rs ― reduce, reuse and recycle ― I’ve added five more directives: record, replace, refuse, refill and rethink. My strategy makes recycling the last resort.</span></p></div>

Glitter is a ready-made microplastic (like microbeads). When washed down drains, it feeds straight into water courses ― from the fairy wands of babes into the bellies of sea creatures. So I tested my strategy on glitter with my 4-year-old niece. It turned out there was one thing she liked more than glitter, and that was penguins. We chatted about penguins, what they eat and the menace of plastic. She quickly came to the conclusion (</span><em><span>on her own</span></em><span>) that if the glitter wasn’t certifiably biodegradable it wasn’t coming to her party.</span></p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="9" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The Obama administration granted the waiver two years later. But that created a new problem for automakers, who argued they would be forced to produce one set of cars for California and another for the rest of the county. In 2012, the Obama administration announced a grand compromise: it would double the federal fuel economy standard by 2025 and require vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon, thus creating a national standard in line with California. The Golden State didn’t get all it wanted, as the federal government declined to set targets for zero-emissions electric vehicles, but automakers feted the agreement as a happy medium. </span></p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="13" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>“Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford newer, safer vehicles that pollute less,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/us-epa-and-dot-propose-fuel-economy-standards-my-2021-2026-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:13;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="0"><span>statement</span></a><span> Thursday.

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="14" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Still,&nbsp;the waiver creates a conundrum for the Trump adminsitration.

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="15" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>“Threatening to revoke California’s waiver is hard to square with their stated respect for states’ having more autonomy,” said Janet McCabe, who served as the assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation until 2017. “I would say that the approach to federalism is inconsistent or selective.” </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="16" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p>Where critics cry foul over a double standard, Trump’s supporters see these rules as further evidence of a messy federal regulatory environment. Even if carbon dioxide warms the planet, and automobiles are the biggest source of emissions in the country, the waiver was meant to provide local relief to California, the thinking goes. But reducing a gas as ubiquitous in the atmosphere as CO2 reaches far beyond that mandate, Bill Wehrum, the EPA’s air chief, said Thursday.</p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="19" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>“What makes this so complicated is that California is the only state that gets to set its own standard and they can only go higher, meaning states like Texas can’t go lower if they believe the federal standard is too stringent,” he said in a phone interview. “This form of federalism is not a real true definition of what federalism should look like.” </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="20" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Yet some efforts to deregulate environmental issues on the federal level require a selective interpretation as to what qualifies as the restoration of states’ rights.

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="4" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Kudos to Th</span><span>e New York Times</span><span> and Nathaniel Rich for publishing “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:4;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="5" data-v9y="0">Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change</a>” ― &nbsp;a comprehensive look back at the history of the climate science and political debates that went on from 1979 to 1989. It tells part of the story of the massive scientific work that went into trying to understand the risks greenhouse gas emissions pose to the planet and then the ― ultimately stymied ― efforts of some climate scientists, advocates and politicians to move that science onto the agenda of American and then international policymakers.</span></p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="5" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The piece begins on a misleading note, stating in the prologue that: “</span><span>The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way — nothing except ourselves.</span><span>” Yet the rest of the article makes it quite clear that the nascent efforts to slow damaging greenhouse gases emissions were stopped not by public opposition or ineffective communication by scientists, but by the clear ideological opposition of conservative Republicans and the Bush White House. </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="6" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>Rich also downplays the direct role that the fossil fuel industry played at the time in both hindering scientific research, hiding what was known (even to them), funding what was to become a massive effort on the part of the climate denial community and buying influence among politicians. That campaign, well catalogued by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in their book “</span><a href="https://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:6;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="0"><span>Merchants of Doubt</span></a><span>,” was fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars of “dark money” that was directed to pseudo-scientific organizations, fake “think tanks” and conservative ideologues.</span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="7" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The world didn’t stop in 1989. Nearly 30 years have gone by and while the basic facts of climate change were well known back then, scientific certainty about climate change has continued to be improved, refined and advanced. The “signal” that humans are changing the climate, which appeared in the late 1980s rising above the “noise” of natural fluctuations in climate, has become a klaxon, blaring its warning.</span></p></div>

<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="8" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>International negotiations have also continued every year to try to find a path forward. At every turn, ideological powers in the U.S., together with a small group of aligned nations (often dominated by fossil fuel producers and interests), continue to block any meaningful agreement. </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="9" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>It’s too late to stop severe climate change – indeed we see it around us. But it is </span><em>absolutely not</em><span> too late to slow the rate of climate change, to accelerate the transition away from coal, and then oil, and then natural gas to the diverse and increasingly inexpensive and effective suite of renewable energy options available to us. We can, and must, still act. </span></p></div>






<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="10" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>As the </span><span>Times</span><span> piece notes, we’ve lost the opportunity to prevent one degree Celsius of warming and without prompt and dramatic efforts almost certainly cannot prevent two degrees of warming. That’s bad enough: It’s probably sufficient to destroy the Arctic ice cap, most shallow tropical reefs, much of the snowpack in the world’s mountain ranges and lead to more extreme floods and droughts. But continued inaction will lead to much worse. Three or four degrees warming – which by the way was enough to mark the difference between planetary ice ages and warm interglacial periods – would wipe out all major coastal cities that can’t spend the literally hundreds of billions of dollars or more needed to build massive seawalls, destroy dozens of low-lying island nations, and make vast areas near the equator brutally – and perhaps unbearably – hot. Five degrees is simply unthinkable.</span></p></div>








<div class="content-list-component yr-content-list-text text" data-rapid-cpos="11" data-rapid-subsec="paragraph" data-rapid-parsed="subsec"><p><span>The good news is that these doomsday scenarios are not inevitable. Progress is being made almost everywhere, except at the national level of the U.S. Other nations, many U.S. states, local governments, responsible companies and individuals are moving forward. Emissions have flattened over the last several years and are starting to come down in many places. The delays of the past 40 years have committed the planet to unprecedented changes and will impose severe costs on all of us, especially on the poorest populations without the resources to adapt. But even more extreme costs can still be prevented if our politicians and the public can put aside blind ideology, anti-science rhetoric and short-term thinking for the sake of our children and the planet.<br><br><a href="http://www.gleick.com" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:11;elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="7" data-v9y="0"><em>Peter H.
