<p>There are new signs that the<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-will-fly-again-but-no-one-knows-when/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> Boeing 737 Max </a></span>won't be flying passengers for a while after the Federal Aviation Administration met with foreign regulators in Fort Worth Thursday to discuss the jet's future. Features on the plane <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-audio-reveals-pilots-confronting-official-about-features-suspected-in-deadly-crashes-2019-05-14/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">may have been a factor</a></span> in two <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-boeing-didnt-tell-airlines-that-safety-alert-wasnt-working-until-after-crash/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">deadly crashes </a></span>in the past year. </p>


<p>Acting FAA administrator Daniel Elwell told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave the agency does not have a timeline for when they expect to get the 737 Max flying passengers again. </p>


<p>"We have to finish our system safety analysis, there will be some test flights that have to be done," Elwell said. "And when we're convinced that the 737 Max is safe to fly again, we will lift the prohibition order."</p>


<p>Aviation regulators from 33 countries where the Boeing 737 Max flies came to a FAA facility in Fort Worth Thursday. At a closed-door meeting Elwell laid out the agency's plan for certifying the Max as safe. Some countries did not attend – a sign the Max may start flying first in the U.S. while the world watches.</p>


<p> "None of us are going to lift the prohibition on the 737 Max until its safe to do so," Elwell said.</p>


<p>As Elwell makes his case for the rest of the aviation world to trust the FAA when the agency is ready to deem the 737 Max ready to fly again, new research shows Americans are leery about setting foot on the Max – even when it's cleared to fly.</p>


<p>A new study by Atmosphere Research Group found only about 1 in 5 people surveyed would definitely fly on a Max in the first six months of its return to service. Roughly half said they'd be unlikely to get on board.</p>


<p> "So it's important that the FAA doesn't regulate by survey, right? We regulate … where in the last 10 years in the United States, 90 million flights, 7 billion passengers carried with one fatality," Elwell said. </p>


<p>Pressed on the how they'll handle public opinion that the plane isn't safe, Elwell said, "Yes we need to be concerned if the public is concerned about flight, yes is that bothersome? It's bothersome. But we can't respond specifically to that concern when it comes to setting safety standards."</p>


<p>It could be the fall before the plane has passengers on it. Boeing said it's still answering information requests from the FAA about the software.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Boeing has hired a PR firm to help restore trust in the Max and plans to rely heavily on pilots as a show of confidence in the plane but some pilots are saying they're not interested in being arm candy.</p>

<p>As a Chicago police officer, Shannon Spalding worked undercover in some of the toughest parts of the city -- only to discover some of the most dangerous criminals were fellow police officers.&nbsp; She risked her life to stop them.</p>


<p>Soon after joining the Chicago Police Department in 1996, Spalding drew an assignment in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city.&nbsp; "It was a full-blown war every single day," she said.</p>


<p>"It was like a movie set.&nbsp; I was shocked.&nbsp; It was shock and awe for me.&nbsp; It was just a completely different world," she explained to <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/whistleblower/" rel="noopener">"Whistleblower"</a> host Alex Ferrer in the series' second season premiere airing Friday, May 24 at 8/7c on CBS.</p>


<p>To survive, Spalding leaned on veteran cops like <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-police-officer-accused-of-extortion-planting-evidence-who-would-believe-us-over-him/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Ronald Watts</a>.</p>


<p>"I thought he was battling crime and he was doing it with finesse and grace," she said.</p>


<p>In 2006, a decade after Spalding was trained by Watts, she had a new assignment in the narcotics division.</p>


<p>"I was the undercover.&nbsp; I would go out, I would make the controlled narcotics purchases," Spalding explained.</p>


<p>Her partner, Danny Echeverria, would swoop in and make arrests. &nbsp; But during police interviews, something strange started happening. </p>


<p>"People would say … 'I can't believe you're going to arrest me when one of your own is actually running the narcotics trade,'" said Spalding.</p>


<p>Spalding learned Watts and his crew would plant drugs on residents of the Ida B. Wells projects and extort cash.</p>


<p>"Even the good citizens that live there, that are law-abiding citizens, they're subjected to this," she said. "We heard … he would put anything from a couple bags to enough to put you away for 10, 15, 20 years."</p>


<p>In 2006, Ida B. Wells resident Delores Allen witnessed this practice firsthand when her son Zarice was pushed up against Watts' police car.</p>


<p>"He goes in his pocket, brings out the drugs.&nbsp; 'If you guys -- I catch y'all again, I'm going to put these drugs on your ass.' That's his exact words," said Delores Allen.</p>


<p>Allen says Watts kept his word.</p>


<p>Later that year, Zarice was arrested and charged with felony possession of heroin and crack cocaine; he was 17 years old. Allen says the drugs were planted by Watts.</p>


<p>"I just seen all his hopes and dreams and stuff just go," an emotional Allen said. "It just went down the drain from there."</p>


<p>Spalding and her partner would eventually learn <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecutors-investigating-if-corrupt-chicago-cop-tainted-other-convictions/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Watts' bad deeds</a></span> had been going on for years.</p>


<p>"If we don't report this criminal conduct we're absolutely no better than Watts or any of these other corrupt officers.&nbsp; And if we do we may just be ending our careers and putting our self in real danger," said Spalding.</p>


<p><strong>"</strong>So, what did you and your partner decide to do?" asked Ferrer.</p>


<p><strong>"</strong>I convinced him that we needed to go to the FBI," Spalding replied. "My greatest fear was that because this was such a long-running … criminal enterprise … I felt that we would be set up for dead."</p>


<p>Spalding and her partner would spend years undercover investigating Ronald Watts and his team. </p>


<p>In February 2012, <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wrongfully-convicted-residents-chicago-housing-project-recall-life-under-corrupt-cop/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Sgt. Ronald Watts </a></span>and one of his officers, Kallat Mohammed, were arrested after being caught robbing a drug courier of $5,200. That courier was Spalding's informant and was wearing an FBI wire. Both Watts and Mohammed were convicted. Watts was sentenced to 22 months and Mohammed received an 18-month sentence. </p>


<p>Aided by that investigation, more than <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/18-more-men-cleared-of-convictions-linked-to-corrupt-chicago-cop-ronald-watts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">60 people wrongfully arrested by Watts and his team have now been exonerated</a></span> -- including Zarice Johnson.</p>

<p>Soon after 10-year-old Darlyn Valle crossed the southern border into the U.S. last year, personnel with the Border Patrol determined <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-death-a-10-year-old-migrant-girl-died-last-year-in-government-care-officials-acknowledge-exclusive/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">she had a debilitating heart condition</a></span>.</p>


<p>Valle had somehow made the 1,400 mile journey from her native El Salvador to Texas, according to Carlos Martinez, president of Asociacion Cívica Salvadoreña de Nebraska, an Omaha nonprofit group that helped arrange legal and postmortem assistance for the girl's family. Valle's name was confirmed to CBS News by the girl's mother.</p>


<p>Valle was just over halfway through the trek from El Salvador to Omaha, where her mother lives, when Border Patrol apprehended her in March.&nbsp;</p>


<p>But she didn't make it to Omaha until September 26. Officials brought her there so she could spend her final three days near her mom.</p>


<p>"Unfortunately right now, the facilities that we have, the resources we've been afforded, and the legal framework that we operate under is not sufficient, is absolutely overwhelmed and it's insufficient. And that continues to be an ongoing challenge," said Robert Perez of Customs and Border Patrol.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>


<p>Mark Weber, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday that the agency oversaw the medical care for a dying 10-year-old girl last year. He said the girl had a history of congenital heart defects. Her death was previously undisclosed to the public.</p>

<p>Martinez's group was founded in 2012, and helps families send bodies of deceased loved ones to El Salvador. Martinez said the government of El Salvador helped pay for the return of Valle's body.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Valle's death was the first of a migrant child in federal care since 2010, according to federal officials.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In the eight months since Valle' death, five children from Guatemala have died either in U.S. custody or soon after being released from custody to a hospital. They ranged in age from 2 1/2 to 16.</p>


<p>The wave of deaths has led lawmakers to call for an investigation into the medical practices of Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>


<p>Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, blamed the White House for the rash of deaths. "As Trump plays politics with asylum-seeking children and their parents, the results are increasingly deadly — with six children dying in U.S. custody since September 2018," Grijalva said in a press release Thursday. &nbsp;</p>


<p>In an interview with CBS News Wednesday night, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Joaquin Castro <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joaquin-castro-says-trump-administration-covered-up-death-of-migrant-girl/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">accused the administration of concealing the girl's death</a></span>, and said he wanted the government to turn over more information. "We're going to make immediate inquires to HHS to find out what happen to this young girl," Castro said. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, chair of the subcommittee that funds the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said in a statement that she would "ensure accountability and transparency."</p>


<p>"It is outrageous that Trump administration officials waited nearly eight months before releasing any information," the statement read. "What would drive these officials to cover up such a serious matter?"</p>


<p>Officials are required to notify local child welfare authorities and report such deaths internally, but are not required to announce them to the public.</p>

<p>Next to pro wrestling, the centuries-old sport of sumo is genteel, and infused with Shinto religious customs.</p>


<p>The sumo wrestlers, known as Rikishi, undergo rigorous, grueling training, and are expected to be role models in Japanese society.</p>

<p>Despite weighing an average of about 360 pounds, wrestlers are surprisingly fast and agile. They're able to push or shove opponents from the ring and win bouts within seconds.</p>


<p>Mr. Trump's sumo outing has already prompted tongue-in-cheek social media speculation about whether the president might don a loincloth himself -- a notion unthinkable to fans in Japan.</p>


<p>"Sumo is not just about being large," one fan told Craft. "These wrestlers have been training since age 15. It would be impossible for Trump to compete."</p>


<p>"What you need to understand is that sumo wrestlers aren't just blobs," another fan told CBS News. "They're actually quite fit. I don't think Trump's in very good shape."</p>


<p>Mr. Trump's visit will take him to the Imperial Palace for an audience with the <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-emperor-of-japan-reiwa-era-naruhito-ascends-chrysanthemum-throne-today-2019-05-01/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">new emperor, Naruhito</a></span>. </p>

<p>"These are all opportunities for the Japanese to put Mr. Trump front and center and in the spotlight," said Nagy. "This is the kind of treatment that he is accustomed to, and I think that It disposes him favorably to the Japanese because he's being flattered."</p>


<p>The president is scheduled to present a trophy in his own name to this weekend's sumo champion.</p>

<p>Yoga instructors are accusing America's largest chain of yoga studios of underpaying its teachers. More than 1,500 yoga instructors have joined a class action lawsuit against CorePower Yoga, claiming CorePower teachers "are overstretched and not being paid the minimum wages they are entitled."</p>


<p>"CorePower probably started out with a mission and a goal that they wanted to bring yoga to everybody, but then it turned into a way to monetize," instructor Effie Morgenstern told "CBS This Morning: Saturday" co-host Dana Jacobson.  </p>


<p>"It's a business that is hiding behind the guise of yoga," another yoga instructor Melissa Brennan said.</p>

<p>Brennan and Morgenstern said during their years teaching at CorePower Yoga, the company didn't pay them what they were legally entitled to. <br><strong><br></strong>"Once you get the job, you're expected to be compensated for the work you do off the clock," Morgenstern said. "Frankly $15 an hour does not compensate you for that work you do off the clock."</p>


<p> "What is that work... and how much time are we talking about?" Jacobson asked.</p>


<p> "We're constantly having to change our playlist, constantly having to sequence, testing it out," Brennan said. "The expectation is go off... do all of this work and then come back and bring it back to the studio." </p>


<p> They said for every one-hour class that they taught, they had to put in up to an additional six hours – unpaid. <br><strong><br></strong>They claim the company is in violation of the fair labor standards act by failing "to pay its instructors for certain hours worked, causing their average weekly compensation to drop below the minimum wages they are entitled."<br><strong><br></strong>"They hide behind the fact that you have all this gratitude and love and appreciation for yoga and your peers, and we met this way," Morgenstern said.&nbsp;</p>


<p>"In a lot of ways they weaponize relationships," Brennan said. "I know there is a part of me that feels really foolish for really buying into that and thinking that these people did care about me."</p>


<p> The suit, the fourth class action with similar complaints against CorePower, also addresses how the company pressures instructors to recruit students to sign up for a $3,000 teacher training.<strong> </strong></p>


<p> "Part of your performance is based on how many people you recruit into the teacher training programs," Brennan said.</p>


<p>"Because they make a lot of money off of those teacher training programs," Jacobson added. </p>


<p> "They do," Brennan said, adding, "They… intentionally keep your wages low unless you do things like sell their teacher trainings, unless you recruit more people into the fold, until you grow that community." </p>


<p> "Somebody would say that's an incentive based. So you have pay but that's your incentive. Why isn't it that?" Jacobson asked.</p>


<p>"When you have a place... that is just charging the maximum, profiting off of their students, dragging people into teacher trainings, and then pouring out teachers... it just dilutes the whole spirit of yoga," Brennan said.</p>


<p> Sheetal Shah agrees.<br><strong><br></strong>"It's absolutely anti-yoga," Shah said. </p>


<p> She launched the "Take Back Yoga" campaign to highlight the Indian roots of the ancient philosophy.<br><strong><br></strong>"It just goes against the very basic tenets of yoga, satya, truthfulness," Shah said. "And you're violating that by telling teachers to prey upon students who may or may not be good as teachers and bring them in for the sole purpose of making money."</p>


<p> Brennan now works out of independent yoga studios, and Morgenstern said she still works at CorePower because some money is better than none.<br></p>


<p>"I don't really have a need to leave aside from the underpayment," Morgenstern said.</p>


<p>"You'd rather make it right?" Jacobson asked.&nbsp;</p>


<p>"I'd rather right and I'd rather make it known that we are underpaid," she responded.</p>


<p>In a statement to CBS News, CorePower Yoga said this lawsuit is without merit and maintains there was no wrongdoing. The company adds, "CorePower is proud of its practices, believes they are fair and will continue to stand by and defend them." The case is expected to be settled out of court, and those three other lawsuits we mentioned were also settled.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the Democratic Republic of Congo facing its deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, the World Health Organization is warning the disease could spread to other African countries.</p>


<p>Making matters worse, the DRC's quarter-century-old civil war is disrupting efforts to treat and contain Ebola. Violence and mistrust hamper efforts, as treatment centers are often attacked by militia groups, and people are either too scared or too suspicious to seek medical assistance here.</p>

<p>CBS News' Debora Patta reports that the city of Beni has been in constant misery after 25 years of civil war. </p>


<p>Nine people were killed in one village by an armed militia group in the past week; then, soldiers took the victims to be tested for disease. It's standard practice – Ebola is at its most contagious immediately after death.</p>


<p>But it doesn't help win over an already suspicious community. "We don't understand what this Ebola is; we can bury the bodies of our people ourselves," said one villager.</p>


<p>A 3,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed in this area to protect villagers from the more than 30 armed militia groups that terrorize the community.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Outreach programs have been launched to educate people about Ebola, but mistrust runs deep, and many don't believe Ebola is as big a problem as security.</p>


<p>USAID's Dr. Bill Clemmer has worked in the DRC for more than two decades and helped with previous Ebola outbreaks.</p>


<p>"I have never been in a context where people throw rocks at our vaccination team, where they block roads, where they loot and pillage our health care facilities," he said. </p>


<p>Beni has all the tools to fight the disease at its disposal, but they are useless if the sick and the dying hide in their homes refusing medical treatment.</p>

<p>Deep inside Vatican City lies a bunker holding a remarkable historical record – a catalog of every word written by every pope over more than 1,000 years. The secret archive holds millions of church documents including decrees and correspondence from every pope dating back more than a millennia.</p>


<p> Lined up, it would stretch more than 50 miles – about the length of the Panama Canal. Today, only academics with special permission can access it; otherwise it's locked away.</p>


<p> Marco Maiorino, a paleographer who studies ancient texts, showed CBS News' Seth Doane the frescoed room where the archives started. Valuable records – including a papal correspondence from the 13th century – have not been digitized and remain inaccessible for most. The document includes obscure abbreviations and are handwritten in Medieval Latin. </p>


<p>Transcribing them is difficult for a human expert, Maiorino said. It's even more difficult for a computer, which needs to identify letters to transcribe and make text searchable. Enter an unlikely group of helpers: hundreds of high schoolers in Rome who are teaching the computers how to read the handwritten Latin.&nbsp;</p>


<p>"The program doesn't know which of these letters are an 'e' or a 'b' so by highlighting them we can teach the program," explained one of the students taking part in the effort. <br></p>


<p>The idea to include the high schoolers was Paolo Merialdo's, a professor at Roma Tre University in Rome. Merialdo enlisted 600 Italian high school students to help the computers develop a linguistic artificial intelligence. </p>


<p> "We are providing a sort of 'Google Translate' for paleographers," Merialdo said. </p>


<p> Artificial intelligence can "democratize" these documents by allowing them to be digitized and made accessible beyond the Vatican walls. The technology could also one day be used to decipher ancient manuscripts anywhere. If successful, so many more people will be able to explore the ancient writings that surround them.</p>

<hr>


<p>Vacation season is heating up, but for many U.S. workers it may be difficult to take time off. That's because America is the only advanced economy in the world that does not federally mandate paid vacation days or holidays. </p>

<p>Workers in 21 advanced economies, including 16 European countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, are all guaranteed paid time off by federal law, according to a report from Center for Economic and Policy Research, a Washington think tank.&nbsp;</p>


<p>However, American workers have to rely on their employers to set the minimum, meaning they may not get any paid time off. Indeed, about one in four American workers don't get any paid vacation days or holidays, the CEPR reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the average U.S. worker in the private sector receives 10 paid vacation days and six paid holidays -- small change compared to what workers in other advanced economies get.</p>


<p>"In the U.S., paid vacation and holiday benefits are based on luck in the boss lottery, not federal policy," said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director at CEPR. "Since we first did this study in 2007, there's been no progress on the national front to catch up with other rich countries."  </p>


<p>"We can't depend on the largess of employers to do the right thing," Appelbaum continued.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some legislators are working to change that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in January announced a proposal to require employers to give workers 10 days' paid vacation; if it passes, New York would be the first city in the U.S. to mandate paid vacation time. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Workers in the European Union are guaranteed at least 20 paid vacation days per year, while six European nations — Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden — guarantee 25 vacation days with an additional 9 to 14 paid holidays. </p>


<p>Spain offers the most total paid days off, with combined 39 vacation days and holidays. Austria follows with 38 total days. </p>


<p>France offers the most in paid vacation, with 30 days, but guarantees just one paid holiday -- for International Workers' Day, or May Day. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Japan and Canada offer 19 and 25 total guaranteed days, respectively. </p>


<p>But the U.S.? Zero.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A banker who prosecutors say tried to buy himself a senior post in President Donald Trump's administration by making risky loans to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was arrested Thursday on a financial institution bribery charge. Stephen Calk, 54, was scheduled to appear in Manhattan federal court in the afternoon. A message was left with his attorney for comment.</p>

<p>Authorities said Calk committed the crime while serving as CEO of The Federal Savings Bank based in Chicago. Federal prosecutors described the charge in a release, saying Calk abused his bank position by approving $16 million in high risk loans that were ultimately downgraded.</p>

<p>"His attempt at petitioning for political favors was unsuccessful in more ways than one - he didn't get the job he wanted, and he compromised the one he had," Sweeney Jr. added.</p>


<p>Manafort lobbied Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to consider Calk for Secretary of the Army, according to emails from the weeks leading up to the 2016 election shown to jurors at Manafort's tax evasion and bank fraud trial last year.</p>


<p>Prosecutors said that while Manafort's loans were pending approval, Calk gave Manafort a ranked list of government positions he wanted, starting with Secretary of the Treasury, followed by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Defense, as well as 19 ambassadorships similarly ranked and starting with the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy.</p>


<p>According to trial evidence, Manafort passed along Calk's resume to Kushner in a Nov. 30, 2016, email, along with two other names of people he said "should be a part of the Trump administration."</p>


<p>Manafort wrote that the individuals would be "totally reliable and responsive to the Trump White House."</p>


<p>He also said Calk was "strong in defense issues, management and finance."</p>


<p>Kushner responded, "On it!"</p>

</div>






<p>Calk was formally interviewed for the position of under secretary of the Army in early January 2017 at the Presidential Transition Team's Manhattan offices, prosecutors noted.</p>


<p>But Calk never got an administration post, though he did approve Manafort's loans.</p>


<p>Manafort is serving a 7½ year sentence on charges he misled the government over his foreign lobbying work and encouraged witnesses to lie on his behalf. He also faces an indictment in New York charging him with state crimes , including a residential mortgage fraud scheme.</p>


<p>In a <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/08/08/chicagoan-is-economic-policy-adviser-to-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 interview with CBS Chicago</a>, Calk called himself a centrist who backed President Obama in 2008. He said he had only met Trump three or four times, at social or charitable events.</p>


<p>"He seemed to take a real interest in the fact that I was a single dad, that I was a family man, that I built my business, and I think he had a lot of respect for that," Calk said.</p>

Jayme escaped in January from Patterson's cabin near the small and isolated town of Gordon, some 60 miles from her home.</p>


<p>A judge sentenced Patterson to serve life in prison without parole, calling him "one of the most dangerous men to ever walk on this planet." Wisconsin does not have the death penalty.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement read by an attorney, Jayme Closs, who was not present in court, said Patterson "took a lot of things away from me. It makes me the most sad he took away my mom and dad."</p>


<p>Closs said she used to love going to school, going out with friends and dancing, but Patterson also took those things away from her. She said she used to love her room and her belongings, but those all now bring back terrible memories because of Patterson. Going out in public, she said, now makes her scared and anxious.</p>

<p>Closs said Patterson thought he could control her, but she described his actions as cowardly. "I was brave, and he was not," the statement said. She said Patterson tried to make her "like" him, but failed.</p>

<p>Bryan Cranston is a Tony Award nominee for his performance in the Broadway version of the 1976 satire "Network," in which news anchor Howard Beale has an on-air breakdown, becoming a "mad prophet of the airwaves."

<p>His rants create a sensation, and his bosses exploit Beale to get better TV ratings for the news.</p>

<p>On "CBS This Morning" Friday, Cranston was asked how he is able to bring forth such anger to his role night after night. "You know, it's part of the actor's toolkit to be able to go inward, to your own personal experiences, and pull out whatever you need at any given time – rage, jealously, love, joy," he said. </p>


<p>"Anger is an emotion that makes people very uncomfortable, but it is also so necessary," said co-host Gayle King. </p>


<p>"Anger, especially now, is usually shunned in our society," Cranston said. "When we see someone who is angry, we don't want to be anywhere around them. But there's a lot of anxiety in our social circles now, in our country, a lot of bitterness and divisiveness. And perhaps anger is a way to drive and release that pressure." </p>


<p>While performing Beale's televised rants, Cranston will go off-stage and interact with audience members, even sitting in the orchestra and sneaking food out of someone's takeout bag. "I have free reign to do whatever Howard Beale wants to do at that moment," he said, "because it's important for that moment, for that audience to see that he is promulgating the idea of letting go. He has gone over to the other side. He says, 'Don't struggle anymore, don't fight against the machine. Let go.'" </p>

<p>Cranston was asked how he approached a character made famous in the film by Peter Finch, who won an Oscar for his performance. "Well, every time you take on a character, for an actor it's outside of you, and the more I work, the more I do research, the more I get into the head of this man, the more he's invited in. And at some point you just trust that the character – for lack of a better term, osmosis – just sinks in to you, and then you operate from that point of view." </p>


<p>Co-host Tony Dokoupil asked what the relevance of the story was today, compared to when Paddy Chayefsky wrote the original film's screenplay in the 1970s. </p>


<p>"When I was a kid growing up watching Walter Cronkite, I always believed what I was listening to was just pure news," Cranston said, "and I believe it still was, but there were decisions being made by producers back then, as there are now. You have 25 stories; we can only get to 12. Who makes that decision of what you're <em>not</em> going to say? Who decides what's news, and what's the more important news? And you hope that it's altruistic in that decision-making. But sometimes an ideology does [influence], 'Well, I believe this is true, so this is what we're going to say.'"</p>


<p>"What's the problem with media today?" Dokoupil asked. "Is it television, as 'Network' has it, or is it now social media?"</p>


<p>"I don't think that today's television media can be absolved of the responsibility of being able to put forward honest good journalism," Cranston said. "Everyone is under pressure of ratings. Ratings and making money. And sometimes you'll see programs that [are] all about promoting that night's shows and things. You're like, 'Is this news, or are we just a promotional vehicle for something else?'" </p>


<p>King asked, "Do you look at [news] differently after playing the role?" </p>


<p>"I think you look at it with a little bit of skepticism, and I think that's prudent," he said. "I think the point of 'Network' is not to put yourself in any kind of tribalistic, ideological camp, to allow yourself to open up, to receive different ideas from all different sources and make up your own mind." </p>

<p><em>Moscow </em>-- A Russian court has extended the detention of a former U.S. Marine arrested on espionage charges. The court ruled on Friday to keep Michigan resident <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-whelan-accused-us-spy-russia-detention3-more-months-today-2019-02-22/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Paul Whelan</a></span>, who also holds British, Irish and Canadian citizenship, behind bars for three more months.</p>

<p>Whelan told reporters in court that he has been threatened and subjected to "abuses and harassment" in prison.</p>


<p>"I want to tell the world that I am a victim of political kidnap and ransom," Whelan said to gathered television cameras from behind bars in the courtroom. "This is retaliation for sanctions. There is absolutely no legitimacy. I have been threatened. There are abuses and harassment that I am constantly subject to. There is a case for isolation. I have not had a shower in two weeks, I can't use a barber I have to cut my own hair. I can't have medical treatment, I can't have dental treatment… This is typical POW Chapter 1 isolation technique. They are trying to run me down so that I will talk to them. This is Salem witch trial mentality and I am asking the world press to go to London, to go to Washington, to go to Dublin."</p>

<p>The American was arrested in a hotel room in the Russian capital at the end of December and charged with espionage, which carries up to 20 years in prison in Russia. The court's decision on Friday was the second time it had granted a three-month extension of Whelan's arrest.</p>

<p>Whelan's lawyer has said his client was handed a flash drive that had on it classified information he didn't know about.</p>


<p>U.S. intelligence and State Department sources&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-whelan-not-spy-us-intelligence-officials-say-russia-ex-marine-espionage/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-whelan-not-spy-us-intelligence-officials-say-russia-ex-marine-espionage/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22have%20told%20CBS%20News%22%7D" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">have told CBS News</a>&nbsp;they're confident Whelan isn't a spy.</p>


<p>Whelan's family, who also deny the accusations against him, have said his Russian lawyer was chosen for him.</p>


<p>That lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer outside the court in Feburary, when Whelan was arraigned, that his client was found at his hotel at the time of his arrest with a flash drive containing Russian "state secrets." </p>


<p>He didn't, however, explain how Whelan came to be in possession of the information on the drive and said his client wasn't aware that the Russian government considered the material sensitive.</p>


<p>"I've worked as an investigator for 20 years and if I do have a smoking gun, I will then put my strongest card on the table, to crush the opponent. In this case I don't see any smoking gun," Zherebenkov said after the February hearing.</p>

<p>He said the prosecution didn't "have strong evidence to back up the charges."</p>


<p>Whelan worked for a Michigan-based auto parts company since 2017, becoming its global security director. He spent 14 years in the U.S. Marine Corps before being discharged in 2008 for bad conduct, according to the military.</p>
