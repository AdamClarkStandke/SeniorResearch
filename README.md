This paper focuses on the problem of identifying whether a web page contains a news article. Contained within this paper is background information about how machine learning algorithms combined with information extraction algorithms and heuristics are able to identify online news articles. This paper also contains an experimental design along with a proposed solution. Lastly, an experiment was run to determine whether the proposed solution of constructing decision trees from features extracted from link-target identification and CoreEx solved the problem of identifying online news articles.
