# DOES A NEWS ARTICLE EXIST WITHIN A WEB PAGE?
### Abstract
This paper and repository focuses on the problem of identifying whether a web page contains a news article. Contained within this paper is background information about how machine learning algorithms combined with information extraction algorithms and heuristics are able to identify online news articles. This paper also contains an experimental design along with a proposed solution. Lastly, this paper contains the results of an experiment that was run to determine whether the proposed solution solved the problem of identifying online news articles. This github repository contains all phases of this project.

### 1. Introduction
Currently, many news based websites include content other than news articles. Often times, a news web page contains no articles at all but other forms of content such as videos, images, and/or slides. Consequently, identifying news articles by automatic means is a nontrivial task. Simple heuristics that may have worked to identify news articles in the early days of the web have become outdated in todayâ€™s web landscape. In order to effectively solve the problem of identifying news articles a multidisciplinary approach must be taken. This project takes such an approach by combining fields of information retrieval, data mining, and machine learning to solve this classification task.
