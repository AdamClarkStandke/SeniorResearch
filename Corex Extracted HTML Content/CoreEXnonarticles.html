Trump confronted Russia in Syria, upped defense spending, increased sanctions, and kept the price of oil down through massive new U.S. energy production. He did not engineer a Russian “reset” or get caught on a hot mic offering a self-interested hiatus in tensions with Russia in order to help his own reelection bid.Three, Russia has a long history of trying to warp U.S. elections that predated Trump and that had earned only lukewarm pushback from the Obama administration.It’s also worth remembering that President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation had been recipients of Russian and Russian-related largesse -- ostensibly because Hillary Clinton had used her influence as secretary of state under Obama to ease resistance to Russian acquisitions of North American uranium holdings.As far as alleged Russian collusion goes, Hillary Clinton used three firewalls -- the Democratic National Committee, the Perkins Coie law firm, and the Fusion GPS strategic intelligence firm -- to hide her campaign’s payments to British national Christopher Steele to find dirt on Trump and his campaign; in other words, to collude. Steele in turn collected his purchased Russian sources to aggregate unverified allegations against Trump. He then spread the gossip within government agencies to ensure that the smears were leaked to the media -- and with a government seal of approval.No wonder that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s partisan team spent 22 months and $34 million only to conclude the obvious: that Trump did not collude with Russia.Mueller’s failure to find collusion prompts an important question. If the Steele dossier -- the basis for unfounded charges that Trump colluded with Russia -- was fraudulent, then how and why did the Clinton campaign, hand in glove with top Obama administration officials, use such silly trash and smears to unleash the powers of government against Trump’s campaign, transition team, and early presidency?The question is not an idle one.There may well have occurred a near coup attempt by high-ranking officials to destroy a campaign and then to remove an elected president. Likewise, top officials may have engaged in serial lying to federal investigators, perjury, the misleading of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the illegal insertion of informants into a political campaign, the leaking of classified documents, and the obstruction of justice.So, how can we tell that the former accusers are now terrified of becoming the accused? Because suddenly the usual band of former Obama officials and Trump accusers have largely given up on their allegations that Trump was or is a Russian asset.Instead, John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Rod Rosenstein are now beginning to accuse one another of wrongdoing.Even their progressive media handlers are starting to sense the desperation in their new yarns -- and the possibility that these hired-gun analysts or guests were themselves guilty of crimes and were using their media platforms to fashion their own defense.The end of the Mueller melodrama has marked the beginning of real fear in Washington.Comey, the former FBI director, has hit the lecture and television circuit with his now-tired moralistic shtick that he alone had a “soul,” while others allowed theirs to be eaten away in "small bites" by Trump. Translated, that means Comey is terrified that former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, whom Comey attacked as a Trump enabler, knows that Comey himself may have broken the law -- and may direct prosecutors on how to prove it.Comey is also in a tiff with his former deputy, Andrew McCabe. Both know that the FBI under Comey illegally leaked classified information to the media. But Comey says McCabe went rogue and did it. Of course, McCabe’s attorney shot back that Comey had authorized it. Comey also claims the Steele dossier was not the chief evidence for a FISA warrant. McCabe insists that it was. It’s possible that one might work with prosecutors against the other to finagle a lesser charge.Former CIA director John Brennan has on two occasions lied under oath to Congress and gotten away with it. He may not get away with lying again if it’s determined that he distorted the truth about his efforts to spread the Steele dossier smears. A former CIA official claims that Comey put the unverified Steele dossier into an intelligence community report on alleged Russian interference. Comey has contended that Brennan was the one who did.It’s possible that both did. Doing so would have been unethical if not illegal, given that neither official told President Obama (if he didn’t already know) that the silly Steele dossier was a product of Hillary Clinton’s amateurish efforts to subvert the 2016 Trump campaign.In sum, the old leaky vessel of collusion is sinking.The rats are scampering from their once safe refuge -- biting and piling on one another in vain efforts to avoid drowning.© 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC</p></div>

Mr Trump and Mr Abe played 16 holes, joined by Japanese pro Isao Aoki. On the lunch menu: double cheeseburgers made with US beef.Then Prime Minister Abe introduced Mr Trump to Japan’s ancient sport of sumo wrestling , which Trump has said he finds “fascinating”.Loud applause greeted Mr Trump as he entered the arena and took his seat a few rows behind the ring. It was a break from the custom of sitting cross-legged on a mat.The Japan Sumo Association instituted some safety precautions due to Mr Trump’s participation, including selling fewer same-day tickets and banning the ritual of throwing seat cushions as an expression of disappointment.Mr Trump sat with his arms crossed over his chest for much of the time, and when the match ended, he walked onto the stage wearing dark slippers — shoes are banned from the ring — to present the cup to Asanoyama.President Trump read from a scroll, praising Asanoyama’s “outstanding achievement”.He hoisted the hefty cup, which the White House said was 54 inches (137cm) tall and weighed 60 pounds to 70 pounds (27 to 32kg), into Asanoyama’s arms with the help of an official. Asanoyama also received trophies from Mr Abe and the emperor.Mr Trump had the trophy made for the sumo winner, and Japanese media informally called it the “Trump Cup”.President Trump’s attendance at the annual sumo tournament recalled the time he spent promoting the World Wrestling Federation in the United States.Trump sponsored major events, appeared in bits and was inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2013.Mr Trump awaited another honour on Monday when he was to become the first foreign leader to meet with Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, since he ascended to the throne on 1 May.Mr Trump and Mr Abe planned more formal talks and scheduled a joint news conference. Trump also was to be the guest of honour at a banquet hosted by the emperor at Japan’s Imperial Palace.“We’ve had a great time, a great day, and tomorrow is really the big event, a very important event in the history of Japan,” Mr Trump said just before enjoying a dinner of grilled chicken, Wagyu beef and vanilla ice cream at a hibachi restaurant with Abe and their wives.“It’s over 200 years since something like this has happened so it’s a great honour to be representing the United States.”The Abe-Trump alliance began even before Mr Trump took office in January 2017, when Mr Abe rushed to New York to greet the president-elect at Trump Tower after Trump’s election two months earlier.Japan is deeply dependent on the US for security, and Mr Abe has tried to encourage Trump to maintain international agreements and keep pressure on North Korea.Golf has been a bonding activity for two leaders who love the game.“We were able to exchange our views frankly in a cosy atmosphere. It was wonderful,” Mr Abe told reporters as he returned to his official residence from the country club. He tweeted a selfie photo of him and Mr Trump smiling widely on the greens.Donald Trump tweeted that he’d had “Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo”.But Mr Trump continued to stew about politics back home, claiming: ”Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed – Death Wish!”Tradition holds that American presidents and candidates avoid politicking while on foreign soil, but Mr Trump is not one to abide by such norms. He also tweeted negatively about Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden, a former vice president.Trump played down North Korea’s recent series of short-range missile tests and tried to lower expectations that he and Mr Abe will make significant headway on trade issues at their Monday meeting.President Trump has sought a bilateral deal with Tokyo since he pulled the US from the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement two years ago, though analysts expect no breakthroughs during the trip.“Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!” he wrote, referring to Japan’s upcoming parliamentary elections.Mr Trump has threatened Japan with new tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts, citing national security grounds.He has suggested he will impose levies if the US cannot win concessions from Japan and the European Union. In April, Japan’s trade surplus surged almost 18 percent to 723 billion yen (£5.2bn).Associated Press</p></div>

This four-part documentary series sees the wildlife cameraman, best known for his Bear/Snow Wolf/Elephant Family and Me series, take a look at the equator from a variety of transports, including hot-air balloons, drones and aeroplanes, and finds the human impact on our planet to be as grim as you might fear. He begins by traversing Africa from east to west, starting in the Rift Valley, where urban expansion is eating into the wilderness, with ecosystems delicately balanced for centuries now tipped dangerously towards species extinction, with knock-on effects throughout the area. Crossing the Maasai Mara, he finds wildebeest migration disrupted by fencing and farmers responding with lethal force when elephants trample their crops. Bleakest of all are the gold mines in the rainforests of Gabon, which bring much needed revenue for the nation but at a grievous cost to the land and the animals that live off it. Aerial photography itself is helping humankind to plot a way forward which protects the natural world; this is eye-opening fare. GT Tennis: French Open ITV4/Eurosport 1, 9.30am, and all week The premier event of the clay-court season arrives, with 11-time champion Rafael Nadal yet again the main contender for the men’s singles title. Novak Djokovic will pose him the biggest threat. In the women’s draw, Simona Halep will defend her 2018 crown, but watch for world number one Naomi Osaka. Formula One: Monaco Grand Prix Sky Sports Main Event/F1, 2.05pm (start time 2.10pm) It may be the world’s most glamorous spectacle, if not always Formula One’s most enthralling race. Mercedes have produced the best start to a season in history: Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton have had five 1-2 finishes in a row, and have left the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel for dead. But the streets of Monte Carlo make for a idiosyncratic challenge; if ever there were a time for the Ferraris to land their first blow of the year, it would be here under the prows of the watching superyachts. Britain’s Greatest Comedians Gold, 8.00pm After a public vote to whittle the contenders down to a shortlist of 30, a nine-strong panel of experts debates who should be crowned the funniest person in the history of the nation. The diverse and pan-generational array of contenders includes Ricky Gervais, Victoria Wood, Stan Laurel and Eric Morecambe. Sally Phillips leads the jury of her peers, including comic actors Stephen Mangan and Nina Wadia, as well as the venerable Roy Hudd. GT&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentleman Jack BBC One, 9.00pm Sally Wainwright’s exhilarating biographical drama continues as Anne Lister (Suranne Jones) begins a tentative relationship with heiress Miss Walker (Sophie Rundle) that’s unpopular among those in the know. Anne’s business affairs, meanwhile, prove equally controversial as the local magistrate resolves to restrict her mining plans. GT Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD E4, 9.00pm As longtime fans will know, death is not necessarily the end in Marvel stories, and the maxim is borne out by the return of Clark Gregg, in spite of the demise of the character he played for so long, SHIELD director, Agent Coulson. Gregg here plays the mysterious Sarge, an apparent antagonist for the forces of the agency dispersed around the galaxy. It’s a fun if inessential adjunct to the Marvel universe. GT &nbsp; What We Do in the Shadows BBC Two, 9.45pm and 10.10pm It’s another raucously enjoyable double bill – thanks, in no small part, to the great Matt Berry – which finds the truce between vampires and werewolves sorely tested and the housemates going into Manhattan in search of a new alliance. GT European Elections Results BBC One, 10.00pm Huw Edwards introduces a night of coverage from around the UK as the votes are counted in the European elections. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party and Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry’s party Change UK are about to discover whether or not they’ve made the hoped-for breakthroughs. GT The 1975 at Radio 1’s Big Weekend BBC Two, 10.30pm Expect to hear The Sound, Chocolate and Give Yourself a Try as frontman Matty Healy and The 1975 roll out the hits as they headline the final day of the festival from Stewart Park in Middlesbrough. GT West Side Story (1961) ★★★★★ BBC Two, 2.35pm; N Ireland, 4.35pm Vertiginous energy and heaps of pure heart make this an American classic, a true original that’s radically told through dance. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer play star-crossed lovers from opposite sides of the New York tracks. Jerome Robbins’s choreography needs the biggest screen it can get; when the movie’s firing on all cylinders of music, lyrics and motion, there’s little to touch it. Arrival (2016) ★★★★★ Channel 4, 9.00pm Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi picture is introspective and philosophical – yet it unfolds with unwavering excitement. At its essence, it’s an alien invasion flick with the invasion on pause. Twelve spaceships appear above points around the globe – then hang there. The US military enlists Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams), an expert linguist, to figure out how to communicate. Forest Whitaker co-stars. Looper (2012) ★★★★☆ BBC Two, 11.30pm; not N Ireland It’s impossible not to be tickled by the playful logic of this sleek sci-fi film, ticking along with the precision of a pocket watch. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a “looper”, an assassin whose targets are zapped back to him from 30 years in the future – until his contract expires and his final target is his future self. It sounds baffling, but it works; among the superb cast are Emily Blunt and Bruce Willis. &nbsp; Monday 25 May Margaret Thatcher, then the Prime Minister, outside 10 Downing Street Credit: PA Thatcher: A Very British Revolution BBC Two, 9.00pm Those who believe that poisonous factionalism and catastrophic division in Conservative ranks is a symptom solely of our Brexit-dominated times might well think again after watching the second episode of Steve Condie’s fine five-part portrait of Margaret Thatcher. It begins with the Conservatives’ general election victory in May 1979 and Thatcher’s first days as prime minster, the selection of her Cabinet and the setting in train of her radical programme to reform the British economy. As those involved recall, the winds of enormous change were in the air and the next two years were among the busiest and most turbulent of Thatcher’s career, with resistance from her Cabinet evident early on and, due to the impact of her monetarist economic policies, deep distrust more widely, too. One internal poll, taken around the time of the 1981 Budget, shows an astonishing 68 per cent dissatisfaction rating with her leadership among Conservative party members. Galloping inflation, sky-high interest rates, mushrooming unemployment, riots in the streets – was it too great a price to pay? Many thought so at the time, yet the lady was not for turning. GO Game of Thrones: The Last Watch Sky Atlantic, 2.00am and 9.00pm If you’re suffering withdrawal following last week’s Game of Thrones finale, this HBO documentary about the making of the final series of the fantasy drama should fill the gap. It promises to “delve deep into the mud and blood to reveal the tears and triumphs involved in the challenge of bringing the fantasy world of Westeros to life in the very real studios, fields, and car-parks of Northern Ireland”. GO &nbsp; Football: Aston Villa v Derby County Sky Sports Main Event/Football, 2.00pm (kick-off 3.00pm) The Championship play-off final at Wembley is, they say, the richest game of football on Earth. By ascending to the Premier League, the winners (according to Deloitte) will earn at least £170 m, and £280 m if they survive their first season. Villa have won both head-to-head matches with Derby, but the Rams will be fired up after toppling top dogs Leeds. And no doubt there will be extra conflict in the dugouts between Villa assistant coach John Terry and Derby manager Frank Lampard, team-mates at Chelsea for 13 years. Springwatch 2019 BBC Two, 7.30pm; N Ireland, 10.30pm Live from the Cairngorms, this is the first of four 90-minute specials this week with Chris Packham, Iolo Williams, Michaela Strachan and Gillian Burke celebrating the joys of spring. Tonight, they launch the UK’s largest citizen-science project, asking viewers to survey their gardens to help map the health of the country’s wildlife. GO Britain’s Got Talent Live Show ITV, 7.30pm The talent show reaches the live semi-final stage and every night this week eight contestants will compete for two of the weekend’s grand final slots and the chance to win a spot in the Royal Variety Performance. GO Confessions of a Serial Killer Channel 4, 9.00pm Filmmaker Ben Zand explores the truth behind convicted killer Samuel Little’s claims to have committed not just the three murders he is in prison for, but another 93 across nine US states. GO The Blitz: Britain on Fire Channel 5, 9.00pm After London, Liverpool was the city worst hit by the intensive bombing campaign against Britain in 1940-41. Over three nights this week, presenters Michael Buerk, Angellica Bell and Rob Bell recall the impact of the Blitz on Merseyside’s firefighters, nurses, an actress and a single mother of six. GO Last Breath: Storyville BBC Four, 9.00pm This BBC Scotland documentary is half an hour longer than it needs to be, but when it gets going it’s a gripper. It tells the atmospheric and extremely tense true-life story of how, in 2012, deep-sea diver Chris Lemons was trapped 3,000 feet below the surface of the icy North Sea with just five minutes of oxygen left in his tank and rescuers a minimum of 30 minutes away. Amazingly, he lived to tell the tale. GO Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014) ★★★☆☆ BBC Two, 11.50am Steve Carell has become a dab hand at making public embarrassment ridiculous and borderline tragic, and he saves the day in this slight but entertaining comedy. Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) blows out a candle for his 12th birthday and initiates a fateful curse, so that his family can learn just how it feels to experience a purely maddening 24 hours. Battle of Britain (1969) ★★★☆☆ Channel 5, 2.15pm An all-star cast fall into line to tell the story of the summer of 1940 and the fight for Britain’s survival after the Allied retreat from Dunkirk. It’s pretty standard fare, but it’s always uplifting to watch Spitfires stick it to the Stukas. Laurence Olivier plays Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, and is joined by Christopher Plummer, Ian McShane, Michael Caine and Susannah York. Guy Hamilton is as assured as ever in the director’s chair. Starter for 10 (2006) ★★★☆☆ BBC Two, 11.00pm; not N Ireland This charming romcom, adapted from David Nicholls’s novel, stars James McAvoy as a working-class lad from Essex who uses his place at Bristol University to achieve his dream of appearing on University Challenge. Along the way, he falls disastrously for two different girls (Alice Eve and Rebecca Hall). Benedict Cumberbatch co-stars. The Smiths, Kate Bush and The Cure are on the soundtrack. &nbsp; Tuesday 26 May Brian Cox&nbsp;at Stegastein, overlooking Aurlandsfjorden, in Norway Credit: BBC/Martin Johnson The Planets BBC Two, 9.00pm The ever-enthusiastic Professor Brian Cox returns with a major six-part series focusing on life on Earth and beyond. The first episode explores the terrestrial planets (made up of rock and metal, rather than gas) – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars – and is utterly enthralling as Cox combines high-end CGI with imagery from space missions to ask big questions about why Earth is the only one on which life has survived. We learn how Mercury went from stable to scorched, why scientists for years believed that Venus might be a verdant jungle and what created its scorching atmosphere, and why Mars became a barren, red desert. Cox’s wide-eyed wonder is still present: “Just look and listen, this is what a planet sounds like after four billion years of evolution,” he exclaims. But there are hard facts amid the excitement and he remains particularly good at breaking down complicated physics into easily digestible chunks. Nor is he afraid to tackle the darker side of life in the solar system. The section on what will happen once the Sun finally dies is fascinating, as is the suggestion of what will follow. It all adds up to a great slice of popular science, which can be enjoyed by everyone. SH Bake Off: The Professionals Channel 4, 8.00pm Fans of profiteroles rejoice: this week’s theme sees the teams tasked with making a tower of choux buns. This being Bake Off, those buns have to be in two different flavours and the fragility of the task soon leads to problems (and some beautiful creations). SH The Great Flood of London Channel 5, 8.00pm The Thames Barrier, built in 1982, was intended to keep London safe from flooding. But, in our changing climate, is the barrier enough? This fascinating documentary looks at what alternative measures are being put in place. SH Master of Photography Sky Arts, 8.00pm The great thing about this photography competition, which returns for a fourth series, is how differently the various contestants interpret each task. The opener sees them capture both the old world and the new in the ancient seaport of Ostia Antica in Italy. SH &nbsp; Years and Years BBC One, 9.00pm Russell T Davies’s audacious blend of family drama, political commentary and futuristic vision continues as Stephen (Rory Kinnear) and Celeste (T’Nia Miller) adjust to their changed circumstances while Viv Rook MP’s (Emma Thompson) rise continues to split the Lyon family. SH Rhythms of India BBC Four, 9.00pm The second episode of Soumik Datta’s lovely guide to Indian music focuses on “the music of the people”. Travelling from Kerala to Maharashtra, from West Bengal to Rajasthan, he considers how everything from religious music to folk is adapting to modern times. SH &nbsp; Nureyev Sky Arts, 10.15pm Jacqui and David Morris’s striking film puts Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev in the spotlight. It delves deep into the dancer’s hypnotic talent – with some breathtaking dance sequences – and considers the demons that drove him. SH &nbsp; On Assignment ITV, 10.45pm; STV, 11.10pm; UTV, 11.15pm Rageh Omaar introduces another trio of reports. In Croatia, Paul Davies looks at how much has changed since the war of 1991. Emma Murphy is in Greenbank, West Virginia to look at lives lived off-the-grid. Finally, Penny Marshall reports on attitudes to death in Gothenberg, Sweden. SH The Man who Knew Too Much (1956)&nbsp;★★★★☆ Film4, 3.15pm This is Alfred Hitchcock’s remake of his own 1934 film. Dr Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and his wife Jo (the late Doris Day, three years after Calamity Jane) are forced to keep silent about a planned political murder. The earlier black-and-white version is a shade more sinister than this take, which is still excellent but much glitzier. The film also won an Oscar for the song Qué Será, Será. Laughing Gravy (1931, b/w) ★★★★☆ Talking Pictures TV, 8.20pm Laurel and Hardy play the fools as deftly as ever in a short film that proves to have an unexpectedly sweet kick in store. The men are lodging with their cranky landlord (Charlie Hall) and their secret dog, “Laughing Gravy” (a Prohibition-era reference to drink). Their efforts to hide the latter’s existence go as well as you’d imagine. Hardy’s slapstick attempts to keep the dog in the house are the highlight. The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) ★★★☆☆ ITV4, 10.00pm Christopher Lee steals the show as the titular assassin, Francisco Scaramanga, in this classic Bond adventure, director Guy Hamilton’s last. Roger Moore, in his second outing as 007, must pursue him with the help of sidekick Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland); they travel to the villain’s island in order to prevent him harnessing the power of the Sun for evil. Moore and Lee’s duels are the best things in the film. &nbsp; Wednesday 27 May Mark O'Halloran and Stephen Graham star in The Virtues Credit: Dean Rogers/Channel 4 The Virtues Channel 4, 9.00pm As much as there is suppressed anger and a profound sadness hanging over Shane Meadows’s exceptional, intimate series, it is the indomitable humour that emerges from the third episode. Joseph (Stephen Graham) goes on another bender after a decision to break into his old care home provokes flashbacks that leave him reeling. The results are unexpectedly hilarious, involving lipstick, wildly inappropriate behaviour and a knockout punch. Once again, the centrepiece is a two-hander, this time between Joe and his sister Anna’s sister-in-law, Dinah (Niamh Algar, impeccable in everything from Pure and The Bisexual to MotherFatherSon of late), yet unlike last week’s heartbreaker, it mines awkwardness for laughs rather than emotion. That said, their conversation still reveals that Joseph’s trauma is as raw as ever and that Dinah, a “hot mess” according to Anna, has her own demons to address. Yet the whole thing deflates in farcically awkward fashion; Meadows is a master of using humour as pressure valve. Next week’s conclusion will likely bring heart-wrenching revelations. The mutual trust between leading man and director may just be driving both to the best work of their careers. GT Europa League Football: Chelsea v Arsenal BT Sport 2, 7.00pm (kick-off 8.00pm) Two London clubs based seven miles apart must fly another 2,500 to Baku in Azerbaijan to contest the Europa League final. This year, Maurizio Sarri’s Blues and Unai Emery’s Gunners have each beaten the other once; this should be a high-octane affair. Crisis in Care BBC One, 9.00pm This excellent, alarming Panorama special follows reporter Alison Holt as she spends 10 months in Somerset, a county with one of the fastest-ageing populations in the UK. How has overspending, underfunding and low staff morale affected the social care system? Holt paints a grim picture of the baleful impact of austerity. GT Summer of Rockets BBC Two, 9.00pm In this week’s episode of Stephen Poliakoff’s Cold War drama, Hannah (Lily Sacofsky) misses her date with royalty, while Samuel (Toby Stephens) meets the men who have been tailing him for the past few years and hears their unpalatable proposal involving his new friends, the Shaws. GT The Blitz: Britain on Fire Channel 5, 9.00pm The engaging documentary series concludes as the fates of actress Mary Lawson, mother-of-six Margaret Johnson and the staff and patients of the maternity hospital are revealed. GT Victorian Sensations: Decadence and Regeneration BBC Four, 9.00pm Erstwhile Time Lord Paul McGann steps back into the 1890s for another fascinating episode of a documentary series which wears its learning lightly. The actor discovers how Victorian values shaped some of the era’s most influential literature, from the taboo-busting social comedies of Oscar Wilde and the untethered imaginings of HG Wells to the unapologetically erotic illustrations of Aubrey Beardsley. GT Mum BBC Two, 10.00pm Always skirting the main event in favour of goings-on on the periphery, Stefan Golaszewski’s glorious family sitcom focuses on Cathy, Michael and co this week as they prepare to go for a walk in the countryside (the walk itself, of course, happens off camera). Not a scene or a second is wasted. GT Black Monday Sky Atlantic, 10.10pm This shallow but entertaining satirical 10-part series from US cable channel Showtime invokes The Wolf of Wall Street without quite matching its ambition. Set in the murky world of high finance during the Wall Street stock market crash of October 1987, it’s told through the eyes of maverick traders the Jammer Group, led by Don Cheadle (Avengers: Endgame) as the slick and forthright Mo Monroe. GT Rim of the World (2019) Netflix, from today Four teenagers are having a good time at summer camp, climbing ropes and piloting canoes, when an alien invasion starts, and our quartet (Jack Gore, Miya Cech, Benjamin Flores Jr, Alessio Scalzotto) are forced to save the world. They are, of course, misfits, and they must, of course, keep a mysterious key safe while they hunt for their families. McG (Terminator Salvation) is directing, so limit your expectations to loud sounds and editing at full throttle.&nbsp; America’s Sweethearts (2001) ★★★☆☆ AMC, 5.00pm In this amusingly madcap romcom, directed by Joe Roth, an estranged pair of spoilt film stars (John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are busy promoting their new film, while their frenetic press agent (Billy Crystal) tries to hoodwink the media into thinking they may reconcile. Julia Roberts stars as Zeta-Jones’s nicer sister. It only works in fits and starts, but given the star power, it’s neat when it does. The Sweeney (2012) ★★★☆☆ Film4, 11.05pm Inspired by the fondly remembered Seventies television procedural, Ray Winstone and Ben Drew (better known as the singer Plan B) play D I Jack Regan and D S George Carter, grizzled lynchpins of the Metropolitan Police’s Flying Squad, who are investigating the shooting of a civilian during an raid on a jeweller. It has its moments, but it doesn’t do the original true justice. Hayley Atwell and Damian Lewis co-star. &nbsp; Thursday 28 May Jason Fox and the Afghan National Police at an outpost on the edge of Lashkargah in Helmand Credit: Channel 4/Plum Pictures The Final Mission: Foxy’s War Channel 4, 9.00pm Jason Fox, former elite Special Forces soldier and presenter of Channel 4’s Meet the Drug Lords: Inside the Real Narcos, embarks on a more personal journey in this documentary. He returns to Afghanistan, nearly a decade after he last set foot in the country where he endured harrowing combat experiences during multiple tours of duty. His aim? To gain a deeper understanding of the people and culture of this complex country, and why he was sent to fight there. In meetings with old comrades and former enemies, Fox asks whether the sacrifices that were made by all sides in the war actually achieved anything? He also returns to the place that left him with the post-traumatic stress disorder that saw him discharged from the Royal Marines and forced to leave behind the life and job he loved. As he says: “Afghanistan defined me as a soldier and made me the man I am. We spent years there fighting in a war that saw some of the fiercest battles in modern British military history. I saw friends get killed and seriously injured and it had a massive impact on not just me, but so many other people. I felt it was important to go back and put some of those demons to rest.” GO Cricket World Cup: England v South Africa Sky Sports Main Event/Cricket, 9.30am England’s status as the top-ranked one-day team has only been burnished by their 4-0 dismantling of a spiky Pakistan side. Faf du Plessis’s Proteas will pose a much sterner test, but Eoin Morgan’s men, on fire not just with bat and ball but in the field as well, will look to get their World Cup campaign off to a flyer. Galdem Sugar BBC Three, from 10am This new reality series explores the challenges of being female in the male-dominated world of grime music. It follows five up-and-coming artists, Laughta, Pre Wavy, C Cane, Madders Tiff and Cassie Rytz, as they come together to make a grime podcast. In this opener, the “galdem” get together for the first time, determined to keep the meeting positive, despite their very different, and very vocal, personalities. GO &nbsp;&nbsp; Golf: The Memorial Tournament Sky Sports Golf, 1.00pm The PGA Tour visits Jack Nicklaus’s home turf, travelling to the Muirfield Village Golf Club near Columbus, Ohio. Bryson DeChambeau returns to defend his title against Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Adam Scott. Springwatch 2019 BBC Two, 7.30pm Michaela Strachan, Iolo Williams, Chris Packham and Gillian Burke look back on an exciting week of nature-watching in the Cairngorms and Cornwall, and explore the natural wonders to be found in compost heaps. GO Ambulance BBC One, 9.00pm The Bafta-winning series returns for a fifth run with the North West Ambulance service. It begins with a call that requires a joint emergency services response when a man becomes trapped under a tram. GO The Good Place E4, 9.30pm The first series of this hit US comedy – in which the selfish Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), who thought that she’d died and gone to heaven, gradually came to realise that she was actually in a fiendish kind of hell – didn’t leave much room for a sequel. So what could be better than simply to wipe the memories of all involved and start over. That’s exactly where we’re at as this second run gets under way, with the architect Michael (Ted Danson) rebooting his infernal experiment. GO &nbsp; Klopp vs Poch: Battle of the Supermanagers Channel 4, 10.00pm Thanks to his hugely popular podcast, Peter Crouch has built up a reputation as a highly entertaining broadcaster. Here, ahead of next Saturday’s Champions League final, he explores how, against the odds, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp and Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino have guided their teams to one of the most anticipated football showdowns in years. GO Great Art ITV, 10.45pm; not STV The last film in this terrific series traces the artistic journey of Paul Cézanne, not through the still-life and landscape paintings for which he’s best known, but through the portraits he made throughout his career. The result is an unrivalled window into his artistic and emotional quest for a lasting legacy. GO Twilight (2008) ★★★☆☆ 5STAR, 10.00pm Director of angst Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) gets her teeth stuck into this enjoyable teenage vampire romance, based on the popular Stephenie Meyer book. Our human heroine, Bella (Kristen Stewart), falls for a beautiful bloodsucker, Edward (Robert Pattinson, the new Batman). Their relationship is sweet, but it’s forbidden – to consummate their love means that they’ll perish. It’s slightly dull, but the climax is nicely violent. Grandma (2015) ★★★★☆ Film4, 11.00pm Behind its innocuous-sounding title, you can just about make out the glint of lupine teeth in Paul Weitz’s film. Lily Tomlin plays Elle Reid, a lesbian poet, whose granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) arrives at her door one morning and asks to borrow $630 in cash – the going rate for an abortion. The pair trawl Los Angeles’s fringes to scare up the funds. It’s funny and absorbing, with moments of emotional perspicacity throughout. The Enforcer (1976) ★★★☆☆ ITV4, 11.00pm Clint Eastwood’s Harry Callahan is teamed with a rookie female partner, Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), in this entertaining but ultimately disappointing third chapter of the Dirty Harry series. Together they’re battling violent eco-terrorists who have kidnapped the mayor of San Francisco (John Crawford) – while, between the various gunfights, hard-bitten Callahan attempts to come to terms with his own male chauvinism. &nbsp; Friday 29 May David Tennant and Michael Sheen in Good Omens Credit: Sophie Mutevelian Good Omens Amazon Prime, from today How you feel about this adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s cult 1990 fantasy novel will almost certainly depend on whether you’ve read the book. For those who have, this is a treat as Gaiman, on sole show-running duties, perfectly captures its wry, witty and occasionally twee English tone. He’s helped immensely by the chemistry between the two leads – David Tennant as Bohemian Rhapsody-loving demon Crowley and Michael Sheen as angel and food fan Aziraphale. They are serving as hell and heaven’s representatives on Earth, and are much better friends than their fellow angels and demons realise. They’re joined by a great cast including Jon Hamm as a smug and very corporate Archangel Gabriel, Frances McDormand as the voice of God (yes, she’s female) and Josie Lawrence as Agnes Nutter, the 17th-century witch whose book of prophecies is the only accurate one in existence. The first episode is a scene setter as the future Antichrist is delivered by Crowley to a convent of satanic nuns, and from there everything starts to go wrong. But if you’re a fan of Pratchett’s tone and Gaiman’s imagination (or vice versa) than settle down for what should be an enjoyable ride. SH My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman Netflix, from today The first series of David Letterman’s new talk show paid dividends largely because of the host’s ability to attract big names. None of the guests are quite as big as former US President Barack Obama this time around, but expect fireworks as Letterman takes on rapper Kanye West, while other guests include Lewis Hamilton and Ellen DeGeneres. SH When They See Us Netflix, from today It’s hard to imagine a better coming-together of a director and subject matter than this new four-part drama. Ava DuVernay, the director of Selma, looks at the events surrounding the infamous Central Park Five case in 1989, and is a visceral, shocking and moving piece of film-making. DuVernay doesn’t pull any punches as she relates how five teenagers were convicted for a brutal rape that they didn’t commit, and she is aided by a cast that shines, with Caleel Harris a particular standout. SH &nbsp; Puppy School Channel 4, 8.00pm The sweet-natured series continues to enthrall, thanks to its combination of heartbreaking stories and helpful puppy training tips. Tonight, the Chinery family hope cockerpoo Benji will help them to deal with their grief. SH The Pompeii Prophecy: Countdown to Devastation Channel 5, 9.00pm The story of what happened to Pompeii following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79 continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists alike. This documentary sifts through the latest evidence to uncover whether there are lessons to be learnt today. SH The Looming Tower BBC Two, 9.30pm This week’s episode of the compelling 9/11 origins drama looks at the ongoing fallout from the battle between the FBI’s John O’Neill (Jeff Daniels) and Martin Schmidt (Peter Sarsgaard) of the CIA for control of a situation that neither man truly understands. This smart, sharp drama is well worth catching. SH The Graham Norton Show BBC One, 10.35pm Graham Norton is joined by Michael Sheen and David Tennant to discuss the fantasy series Good Omens (see above), Gloria Estefan pops in to talk about her new musical On Your Feet, and the Jonas Brothers provide the music. SH Casino (1995) ★★★★☆ Dave, 9.00pm Martin Scorsese seems to be parodying himself in this portrait of a bookie who runs a casino for the Mob. Robert De Niro is strangely dull in the central role, but Joe Pesci, as mob enforcer Nicky Santoro, serves up even more frantic violence than he did in Goodfellas. The quiet star, however, is Sharon Stone, sensational here as the proverbial tart without a heart. Over on ITV at 10.00pm, meanwhile, is Goodfellas itself. Mamma Mia! (2008)&nbsp;★★★☆☆ Channel 5, 10.00pm This musical comedy, set to Abba’s hits, is a slice of pure escapism. It’s naff, but that’s its selling point, as stars Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Julie Walters place their tongues firmly in their cheeks. At 59, Streep deserved extra credit for doing the splits in her role as a boho mother living on a Greek island whose daughter (Amanda Seyfried) tries to find out who her biological father is. Suspend your intelligence and enjoy. For a Few Dollars More (1965) ★★★★★ BBC Two, 11.05pm The greasy, sweaty, cigar-chewing Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) returns for the second film in Sergio Leone’s Dollars trilogy. Two rival bounty hunters (Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef) join forces to capture a homicidal bandit called “El Indio” (Gian Maria Volonté). The raw violence is oddly poetic, Volonté seethes all the way through, and Leone’s close-ups create a superbly tense atmosphere. Television previewers Vicki Power (VP), Gerard O’Donovan (GO), Gabriel Tate (GT), Sarah Hughes (SH), Toby Dantzic (TD)</p></div>

<h2>'Niki we wiss you'</h2>
<p>Mercedes are running a scarlet halo in front of the cockpit for the weekend, with a farewell message for their non-executive chairman. There's a small hint of irony here, however. Lauda, never afraid to speak his mind, was not a fan of the new protective measure in front of a driver's head — believing that a degree of danger simply came with the territory in F1.</p>
</div>

<h2>Sebastian Vettel's throwback helmet</h2>
<p>Niki Lauda won his first two titles at Ferrari, with his trademark scarlet helmet a perfect fit at the Italian team. At Monaco, Sebastian Vettel will wear this in the 70-year-old's memory. The times have changed somewhat, of course. The 2019 version is covered with rather more adverts than Lauda's was; and the one old sponsor Marlboro is now Philip Morris' "Mission Winnow" e-cigarette venture.</p>

<h2>Toto Wolff: 'This is very difficult for all of us'</h2>
<p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff lauded Lauda's no-nonsense approach: "I feel that we have lost what was the heart and soul of Formula 1. Niki Lauda could say everything he wanted. Sometimes it gave the communications teams gray hair! But Niki's comment would be, 'who cares?' In today's corporate world, it was so refreshing and important for F1 to have someone who just didn't care." </p>

<h2>Mercedes honor their late non-executive chairman</h2>
<p>Lauda may have won his titles at Ferrari and McLaren, but his most recent post in the paddock was as part of Mercedes' management. Lewis Hamilton, a friend of Lauda's, was excused media duties on Thursday as a result of the Austrian's passing. Lauda convinced Hamilton to join Mercedes in 2013, when the move appeared to be a gamble, at best. Four titles in six years followed.</p>

<h2>The original McCoy</h2>
<p>Monaco's one of F1's truly timeless venues. The street circuit has not changed much since Lauda's days. Lauda won twice around the principality, on his way to his first world championship in 1975, and early in the 1976 season, before his life-changing accident at the Nürburgring. </p>

<h2>Ferrari's name plate</h2>
<p>As in the successful seasons between 1974 and 1977, the Ferraris will bear Niki Lauda's name in white for this weekend's race. Ferrari go into the race in real need of a result, after Mercedes finished 1-2 in all five of the races so far this season — something no other team has ever achieved.</p>

<h2>'Thanks Niki'</h2>
<p>Toro Rosso, yet another F1 team brimming with Austrian DNA, will also carry a tribute to the 1970s hero. The grid is reportedly in discussions to hold a minute's silence in Lauda's honor on race day on Sunday. One F1 veteran, Mark Gallagher, joked on Twitter that the paddock should consider a tribute to match Lauda's persona, suggesting "2 minutes of no-bullshit, plain speaking in the paddock." </p>

<h2>Seventy years of speed</h2>
<p>Haas Grand Prix will also pay homage to the Viennese racer this weekend. The US-owned team captioned a photo of their repainted "shark fin" above the car's engine cover with a simple message: "Remembering Niki. In our thoughts this weekend."</p>

<h2>DFB Cup final</h2>
<p>Alongside the Bundesliga championships, the DFB German Cup is the Bundesliga’s second-most important title. It includes clubs from both the first and the second Bundesliga as well as qualifying clubs from lower leagues. Since 1985, the final of the DFB Cup is carried out at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. This year FC Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig will compete for the trophy.</p>

<h2>Imposing geometry</h2>
<p>The monumental stadium is situated on a large expanse of land at the western edge of Berlin. Even today, it’s still dominated by the unadorned façade faced with dressed limestone. With its five rings, the fifteen-meter-wide Olympic gate at the entrance recalls the arena’s original purpose.</p>

<h2>A propagandistic opening</h2>
<p>The stadium was built for the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. Adolf Hitler, who had become Reich Chancellor several years before, was keenly aware of the importance of the games and supported the arena’s construction. At the opening on August 1, he staged a major propaganda event, marching into the stadium before a cheering crowd of 110,000 spectators.</p>

<h2>Post-war-era</h2>
<p>To this day, visitors to the adjacent Mayfield bell tower can enjoy a view of the stadium grounds and the city beyond. But this tower is a reconstruction dating from 1962 – the original structure was destroyed in the war. The original bell, which was the emblem of the 1936 Summer Games, was also destroyed. Today the tower is both a memorial and a viewing platform.</p>

<h2>Hertha's home arena</h2>
<p>After years of economic revival in the Federal Republic of Germany, the Bundesliga soccer league was founded in 1962. Beginning with the first 1963-1964 season, the Olympic Stadium was the arena for Hertha BSC’s home matches, here shown playing their first match against FC Nuremberg. Berlin fans are traditionally seated in the eastern end of the stadium.</p>

<h2>Post 2000 modernization</h2>
<p>After Germany got the nod for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Berlin’s Olympic Stadium was given an overhaul. Alongside many technical renovations, all 75,000 spectator seats were covered by a roof. The surrounding athletic track was changed to blue and white, the colors of the Hertha BSC home club.</p>

<h2>Stadium chapel</h2>
<p>During the renovations, a Christian chapel was build under the main tribune of the arena. The German national squad is said to have attended a service here before the 2006 FIFA World Cup Quarter Final match against Argentina – a match they won in a penalty shootout. But it’s not just athletes who make use of the chapel. True-blue Hertha fans can celebrate weddings and baptisms there.</p>

Born in South Africa, raised in Scotland and educated at Oxford, <strong>Sister Wendy Beckett</strong> (February 25, 1930-December 26, 2018) was a sister of the Catholic Church who taught literature in Cape Town until she suffered three grand mal seizures and was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy. She returned to England in 1970, moving into a trailer on the grounds of the Carmelite Monastery in East Anglia. She would maintain the responsibilities of a hermitic life even after appearing as the host of a BBC documentary series, "Moving Art," in 1991.</p><p>Standing in front of paintings in her nun's habit, Sister Wendy discussed artwork without a script or teleprompter. The series was a hit, and made the 61-year-old an unlikely TV star. Her debut was followed by several other series, including "Sister Wendy's Odyssey," and "Sister Wendy's Grand Tour," in which she visited landmarks of art in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid and elsewhere. She also wrote 15 books on art and religion. </p><p>In 2000 she talked with PBS producer David Willcock about how she chose the American museums to feature in her series "Sister Wendy's American Collection": "If I had stuck just to what I myself love best, every program would have been exactly the same, because each of these museums has superb holdings in my four favorite areas – medieval art, Oriental art, ceramics, and the Old Masters. But nobly, self-sacrificingly, thinking only of the good of others, I forced myself to investigate areas of art into which perhaps I had up to now taken little interest. As always happens with self-sacrifice, I was blissfully rewarded."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Victoria Arocho/AP</p>                    </li>

"It didn't work," she said, not that she had to. Marshall's distinctive voice and smart-alecky delivery were the bedrock of her character Laverne DeFazio, a brewery worker who dreams of better things, in the top-rated '70s sitcom "Laverne &amp; Shirley." The series would take her character from Milwaukee to California during its eight-year run (with even a cartoon spinoff along the way). Her early roles also included Myrna, Oscar's secretary, in "The Odd Couple," and appearances on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Love, American Style."</p><p>But she became a formidable force behind the camera, as the director of the comedies "Big" (featuring Tom Hanks as a 12-year-old boy magically transformed into a 30-year-old boy), and "A League of Their Own" (in which Hanks' coach memorably castigates a player with "There's no crying in baseball!"). Both movies passed the $100 million gross mark, blazing a trail for female-directed films.&nbsp;</p><p>Marshall's other credits included "Awakenings," starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro (only the second film directed by a woman to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar), "The Preacher's Wife," and "Riding in Cars With Boys." </p><p>In her memoir "My Mother Was Nuts," Marshall wrote that she never wanted to grow up, still seeing a connection to the little girl in the Bronx who'd plead with her mom to be allowed to play outside for five more minutes: "Through all the changes and the challenges of adulthood, I have never strayed too far … from that little girl with the ponytail and the overbite who wanted to keep playing for five more minutes."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Paramount Television/ABC</p>                    </li>

Influenced by Dinah Washington, Nat King Cole and others, Wilson covered everything from jazz standards to "Little Green Apples," and in the 1960s alone released eight albums that reached the top 20 on Billboard's pop charts.</p><p>Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, the eldest of six children of an iron foundry worker and a maid, Wilson sang in church as a girl and by age 4 had decided on her profession. In high school she won a local TV station's talent contest and was given her own program. When she later moved to New York, she soon had a regular gig at The Blue Morocco. Then, a demo recording of "Guess Who I Saw Today" got her a phone call from Capitol Records. "Within six weeks I had all the things I wanted," she said in an interview. </p><p>Sometimes elegant and understated, or quick and conversational and a little naughty, she was best known for her breakthrough "Guess Who I Saw Today," and the 1964 hit "(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am," which drew upon Broadway, pop and jazz. </p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/Nancy_Wilson_Guess_Who_I_Saw_Today.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play excerpt: "Guess Who I Saw Today"</a></strong></p><p>"How Glad I Am" brought her a Grammy in 1965 for best R&amp;B performance, and she later won Grammys for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2005 for the intimate "R.S.V.P (Rare Songs, Very Personal)," and in 2007 for "Turned to Blue," a showcase for the relaxed, confident swing she mastered later in life. She performed worldwide at nightclubs, concert halls and jazz festivals.</p><p>Wilson also had a busy career on television, film and radio, including years hosting NPR's "Jazz Profiles" series. Active in the civil rights movement, including the Selma march of 1965, she received an NAACP Image Award in 1998.</p><p>She resisted being identified with a single category, especially jazz, and referred to herself as a "song stylist," covering songs by Stevie Wonder, the Beatles and Aretha Franklin.</p><p>"The music that I sing today was the pop music of the 1960s," she told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2010. "I just never considered myself a jazz singer. … I take a lyric and make it mine.

She won raves, and an Oscar nomination, for her debut film performance.</p><p>She was best known for the six films she made with director and co-star Clint Eastwood (whom she dated for 13 years), starting with the Western "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976), and including "The Gauntlet," "Every Which Way But Loose," "Any Which Way You Can," "Bronco Billy," and the Dirty Harry movie "Sudden Impact."</p><p>Locke also played singer Rosemary Clooney in a 1982 TV biopic, and directed the 1986 film "Ratboy," which flopped in the U.S., but was popular with critics in Europe.&nbsp; </p><p>In 1997 she released her memoir, titled "The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly: A Hollywood Journey," an account of her tumultuous relationship with Eastwood (she would sue him for palimony, and then fraud), and her battle with breast cancer.

The man claimed to be Howard Hughes, an aviation and business tycoon who spent years in seclusion. "He told me who he was, but I didn't believe him," Dummar told the AP in 2006. "I thought he was just a bum or a prospector or something." Dummar ended up driving the man nearly 190 miles to Las Vegas before giving him some pocket change and dropping him off behind the Sands Hotel.</p><p>About eight years later, after Hughes died, a handwritten will, rife with misspellings, was dropped off at Dummar's gas station, addressed to the Mormon Church. The will named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as beneficiary of $156 million – a 1/16 share of the Hughes estate – and also bequeathed $156 million to Dummar for rescuing him in the desert.</p><p>For years Dummar, whose story was depicted in the 1980 film "Melvin and Howard" (starring Paul Le Mat as Dummar and Jason Robards as Hughes), fought legal battles over the authenticity of the will. Jurors and judges decided against him. "I've been called everything from a crook to a forger," Dummar told the AP in 2007 in Utah, where he was then running a business selling frozen meat. "I don't care what people say - as long as they get the facts straight."</p><p>In 2005 a retired FBI agent uncovered new evidence and witnesses supporting Dummar's claim of finding Hughes and driving him to the Sands, and about the delivery of the envelope containing the will. But in 2008 a U.S. appeals court affirmed a Nevada state court jury's decision 30 years earlier that found the will was a fake.</p><p>"You've got to keep on living," Dummar told the Salt Lake Tribune in 2005 about his set-backs. But as the aspiring songwriter wrote in "All-American Dreamer":</p><p><em>Some say I'll never make it. <br> But one day I will score. <br> Some say I've lost the battle. <br> But I don't think I've lost the war.</em></p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

When you start off, the market goes up and then they're happy; when the market goes down, then they panic. So it's a bit like that with … a band. When you start out and you have initial success you think, 'Oh, this is great. We can do anything we want.' And then you get bad reviews and then you think, 'Oh no, the whole world is falling apart.'

More than 5,000 men have passed through his program, what Robertson called his greatest achievement.&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn." It was partially a prescient statement: <strong>President George H.W. Bush</strong> (June 12, 1924-November 30, 2018) would soon watch as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union dissolved, ending a decades-long Cold War. But he also spearheaded an international military strike against Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi dictator invaded neighboring Kuwait.</p><p>Born in 1924, the second-oldest son of investment banker and future Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, he served as the Navy's youngest pilot during World War II, and was shot down in the Pacific over the island of Chichi Jima. After marrying Barbara Pierce, he became an oil man in Texas before entering <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a>. A Congressman, RNC Chairman, United Nations Ambassador, Envoy to China and CIA Director, Bush would become Vice President under Ronald Reagan before succeeding him in office. [He would also become only the second U.S. president to see his own son become a president himself.] </p><p>Following the Gulf War, in 1991, President Bush's approval rating was nearly 90%. And yet, the following year he lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton, owing to his having broken his 1988 campaign mantra: "Read my lips: no new taxes." In his concession speech he allowed that he would continue to find ways to serve the public, while also getting active in "the grandchild business."</p><p>Coming from a family that prized public service, Mr. Bush had heralded "a thousand points of light" as a marker of community and volunteerism, and promoted those efforts beyond the White House. He also worked with fellow former presidents to raise millions for hurricane disaster relief and recovery. And if age ever got the better of him, it was hard to tell: on his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays he marked the occasion by skydiving. </p><p>He was as accepting about his 1992 election loss as his public demeanor suggested. In a 1996 interview for "Sunday Morning," Mr. Bush told Paula Zahn, "There wasn't any period of self pity or thinking, on the other side of it, thinking you were entitled to a grand lifestyle.&nbsp; … There was no [more] decision-making. Went from one day making decisions, getting worried about getting a call that something was wrong, the next day nothing, nobody gives a damn about what I thought, cared.

Instead, <strong>Bernardo Bertolucci</strong> (March 16, 1941-November 26, 2018) would establish himself as a major name in international cinema, uncowed in dramatizing stories involving <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a>, class warfare, spirituality, eroticism and incest. Beginning his career as an assistant director for Pier Paolo Pasolini, he made his first film, "The Grim Reaper," about the murder of a prostitute, in 1962. By the early 1970s, he had already directed several acclaimed features, including "Before the Revolution," "The Spider's Strategem," and "The Conformist," a visually astonishing tale of a bureaucrat (Jean-Louis Trintignant) subsuming himself to the orders of Mussolini's secret police.</p><p>It was his bold and improvisational 1973 feature "Last Tango in Paris," starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider as a middle-aged man and younger woman engaged in a brutal sexual relationship, that earned Berlotucci both critical kudos and censorship. (The movie was banned in Italy.) He would later win two <a href="/oscars/" data-is-autolink="true">Academy Awards</a> for writing and directing the sumptuous 1987 biopic "The Last Emperor" (pictured), the first Western production to be shot in Beijing's Forbidden City. </p><p>Bertolucci's other films include the five-hour epic "1900," about Italy during the rise of fascism, starring Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu and Dominique Sanda; "The Sheltering Sky," based on the Paul Bowles novel of an American couple's disintegrating relationship during a trip to Africa; "Little Buddha," about Siddharta; and "The Dreamers," an erotic drama set against the 1968 student riots in Paris. </p><p>In 2014 Bertolucci talked with <a href="https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-bernardo-bertolucci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Film Comment magazine</a> about "Last Tango," his most talked-about film. (Schneider complained that Bertolucci had not properly warned her about the improvisational sex scenes.)</p><p>"When I started, I didn't know where I could go with Marlon Brando and Maria. Because there is something that you can't tell in the screenplays – and it's exactly what's missing from screenplays, which is the flesh and blood of the real people in front of the camera. The script describes the characters, but when you go to shoot, you try to invent life in front of the camera."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Neal Ulevich/AP</p>                    </li>

How'd he do it? <em>Magic!</em></p><p>He collected and researched the history and lore of magicians and illusionists, and was author of such books as "Cards as Weapons," "Learned Pigs &amp; Fireproof Women" and "Celebrations of Curious Characters."</p><p>His expertise at illusions was also enlisted for the production of movies like "The Escape Artist," "The Prestige" and "Forrest Gump." He also acted in films and TV shows, including "Boogie Nights," "The Spanish Prisoner," "House of Games," "Deadwood" (as card sharp Eddie Sawyer), and the James Bond film "Tomorrow Never Dies," as a terrorist. </p><p>Magic, Jay told The New Yorker, "gives me more pleasure and more pain than anything else I've ever dealt with.

That was the sage advice of Oscar-winning screenwriter <strong>William Goldman</strong> (August 12, 1931-November 16, 2018) when asked for the secret of what made a successful film.</p><p>He <em>should</em> have known; Goldman won <a href="/oscars/" data-is-autolink="true">Academy Awards</a> for writing "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men" (for which he coined the immortal phrase "Follow the money"). He also wrote the screenplays for "The Princess Bride," "Marathon Man" and "Magic" (each adapted from his own novels), "Harper," "The Hot Rock," "The Stepford Wives," "The Great Waldo Pepper," "Misery" and "The Ghost and the Darkness," among others. </p><p>After the Chicago-born Goldman received his master's degree from Columbia University in 1956, he penned a novel, "The Temple of Gold," in under two weeks, and sold it to Knopf. More than 20 novels followed (some published under pen names), including "Soldier in the Rain" and "No Way to Treat a Lady," both of which became films. Goldman found work in movies himself (as did his older brother, James Goldman, who would win the Oscar for adapting his historical play, "The Lion in Winter"). In addition to his own screenplays, he also found service as a highly sought-after script doctor on such films as "A Few Good Men," "Twins," "Dolores Claiborne," "Malice" and "Indecent Proposal."</p><p>In 1983 as his career was beginning to cool (a screenplay he'd written for "The Right Stuff" was rejected), he wrote a memoir of his years in Hollywood, "Adventures in the Screen Trade," an invaluable treatise on the business and art of filmmaking. Other non-fiction books included "Wait Till Next Year," a collection of sports writing; and "Hype and Glory," about his experience judging the Cannes Film Festival. </p><p>Goldman always wanted to write, but his early aspiration was to be a sports writer, and he did not seem to take the results of his Hollywood labors too seriously. In "William Goldman: The Reluctant Storyteller," he rejected analysis of his work. "I'm just trying to tell a story," he said. "I wrote a movie called 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' and I wrote a novel called "The Princess Bride,' and those are the only two things I've ever written, not that I'm proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

"That sounds good. So I started trying to think of some names. Insect-man? Nah. Mosquito-man? Nah. And then I got to Spider-man. Spider-man, <em>ooh, that sounds dramatic!</em>&nbsp; And if he has spider power, he can shoot a web also. And he could swing ... oh man! And then I figured I'd make him a teenager, and I figured I would do the unthinkable: I'd give him personal problems.</p><p>"I ran into my publisher and I said, 'Have I got an idea for you! His name is Spider-man ...' And I couldn't get any further. He said, 'Stan, that is the worst idea I have ever heard!'"</p><p>The rest, of course, is the stuff of comic book lore, one of the premier characters Lee helped create at Marvel. He was the comic book company's top writer, and later its publisher. Working with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Lee's wild ideas helped bring Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, Black Panther, and the Fantastic Four to life, making Lee a God of the Marvel Universe. </p><p>But it wasn't just his childhood fascination with Errol Flynn that inspired his comic books' derring-do. His superheroes had super powers, but also flaws, arguing amongst themselves and dealing with hang-ups – all key ingredients that went into his most famous character of all: Spider-man. His characters could also offer social commentary, refusing to shy away from the issues of the day, like war, race relations and drug abuse. </p><p>Lee's genius for vivid characters and stories left a mark on the popular imagination of generations of comic book fans, which translated to theatergoers when Marvel movies (in which he habitually appeared in cameos, with a nod and a wink) became box office powerhouses. </p><p>In a 2006 Associated Press interview Lee said of his comic book stories, "I think everybody loves things that are bigger than life. ... I think of them as fairy tales for grown-ups."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Reed Saxon/AP Photo</p>                    </li>

A former student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in London, he was head of the English acting section of the National Theatre School of Canada and a founding member of the Stratford Festival, in Ontario, where he spent 32 seasons performing Shakespeare. He was nominated for a Tony Award in 1972 for his role as William Cecil in "Vivat! Vivat! Regina!"</p><p>But his most indelible role came as a result of narrating a 1960 National Film Board of Canada short, "Universe," the visual effects of which had inspired Kubrick. The director turned to Rain to voice his on-board computer, after deciding the recorded performance by Martin Balsam was too emotional. </p><p>A supposedly perfect artificial intelligence who covers up a mistake by attributing it to "human error," and whose dialogue drips with irony, Hal murders the ship's crew members before he is "lobotomized" by the mission's sole survivor, David Bowman (played by Keir Dullea). Rain was chillingly neutral, whether talking about chess or locking an astronaut outside the ship. When asked by Bowman to let him back inside, Hal flatly responds, "I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that." </p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/2001_Douglas_Rain_as_Hal_9000.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excerpt: Douglas Rain as Hal in "2001: A Space Odyssey"</a></strong></p><p>Rain would return as Hal in the 1984 sequel, "2010," and was heard in an uncredited performance as a computer in Woody Allen's "Sleeper." He also narrated the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, "The Man Who Skied Down Everest." And Hal's flat delivery would inspire Anthony Hopkins' performance as serial killer Hannibal Lecter.</p><p>Given his half-century career as a stage, radio and TV actor, Rain was dismissive of his immortal performance in "2001," which encompassed two days in a sound booth being fed lines by Kubrick. "If you could have been a ghost at the recording session," Rain recalled for the <a href="http://2010odysseyarchive.blogspot.com/2015/01/douglas-rain-immortal-voice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"2010 Odyssey Archive" blog</a>, "you would have thought it was a load of rubbish."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Stratford Festival; MGM/Warner Brothers</p>                    </li>

Their idea to take computers out of university and research labs and put them in people's hands was sparked in 1974, in Boston (Gates was then attending Harvard, Allen was a college dropout), when they came across a notice for a new small computer sold to hobbyists, the Altair. In eight weeks Allen and Gates wrote code that could run on the Altair and pitched it to the company. It was the birth of Microsoft, a giant in personal and business computing.</p><p>After creating the code MS-Basic, Microsoft developed and refined the operating system for IBM computers, which became the core of IBM PCs and clones. By 1991, Microsoft's operating systems (and such programs as Word and Excel) were used by 93 percent of the world's personal computers. Allen was Microsoft's executive vice president of research and new product development until 1983, when he resigned after being diagnosed with cancer – and he pursued a wide range of interests with the passion of a cancer survivor. "To be 30 years old and have that kind of shock – to face your mortality – really makes you feel like you should do some of the things that you haven't done yet," Allen said in a 2000 book, "Inside Out: Microsoft in Our Own Words." </p><p>One of the world's richest men, he devoted more than $2 billion of his wealth to philanthropy (including founding the Allen Institute for Brain Science). He also spent on such interests as music (he played in his own rock 'n' roll band, and built Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture), sports (he bought the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers), science (he funded an antenna farm listening for signals from outer space, and built the aerospace firm Stratolaunch), movies (he invested in DreamWorks), and travel (he built a yacht longer than a football field, equipped with its own submarine).</p><p>"Look, in the Microsoft days, you had some great ideas and some great execution between me and Bill and many other people," he told <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-allen-and-the-birth-of-the-pc-microsoft-2011-60-minutes-interview/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">"60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl in 2011</a>.

But his greatest success came through his monumental work with The Beatles on such landmark albums as "Revolver" and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."</p><p>A London native fascinated by music and technology from an early age, Emerick was an invaluable part of the Beatles' legacy as they became increasingly ambitious and experimental in the studio (including the embrace of effects like backward tape loops and double tracking). He was on hand as an assistant during the Beatles' early EMI sessions in 1962, and was promoted in the mid-1960s. </p><p>Producer George Martin recalled in a 1990s documentary that Emerick was unconventional: "He used to do really weird things [with microphones] that were slightly illegitimate, with our support and approval." His innovations on "Sgt. Pepper" included enhancing the sound of Ringo Starr's drums on "A Day in the Life" by loosening the skins and wrapping a microphone in a tea cloth and placing it in a glass container. McCartney also recorded bass lines after the rest of a given track was done – an unusual practice at the time.</p><p>Emerick became frustrated during the recording of the "White Album" and briefly quit, but returned for "Abbey Road," and worked with Paul McCartney on his solo "Band On the Run" album. He won three Grammys for engineering, and received a lifetime achievement award in 2004. </p><p><strong><a href="http://docs.cbsnews.com/17/MP3s/Sgt_Pepper_A_Day_In_The_Life_excerpt.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play excerpt from The Beatles' "A Day in the Life"</a></strong></p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Courtesy paulmccartney.com</p>                    </li>

His first notable building was a house he designed for his mother in Philadelphia's Chestnut Hill neighborhood in 1961. It broke from the established architectural thinking of the time, that a modern house should contain no historical elements. Architect Frederick Schwartz referred to the Vanna Venturi House (pictured) as "the first postmodern anything."</p><p>"A while back, when it was considered very daring, we did very simple things," Venturi said in 1991.

His subsequent releases showed an increasing reliance on the music of Africa, and he traveled extensively on the continent, exploring his musical roots.

A year after graduating Juilliard in 1953, at age 24, Taylor founded his own company, collaborating with artist Robert Rauschenberg on his first production. A year later he became a soloist for Martha Graham, while continuing to shape his own company into one of the world's most successful contemporary troupes.</p><p>The pairing of classical music (particularly 18th-century Baroque) with modern dance was one of Taylor's hallmarks. His signature work was 1975's "Esplanade" (center), a joyful scene of dancers hurtling themselves at each other, set to concertos by Bach. Taylor also created dances for such noted artists as Mikhail Baryshnikov (right top) and Rudolf Nureyev.</p><p>Taylor kept working well into his 80s, venturing to his company's Manhattan studios from his Long Island home to choreograph two new pieces a year; he created 147 in all during his 64-year career. </p><p>In the 2014 documentary "Paul Taylor: Creative Domain," the choreographer said, "Dance, I've always thought it's like poetry.

Humor helped get him through the difficult times. "Well, it <em>explained</em> things to me anyway," he told "Sunday Morning" in 2006. "It made it easier to deal with if you were able to laugh at it."</p><p>Simon often used his own experiences for comic material, from "Biloxi Blues" to "Brighton Beach Memoirs" and "Broadway Bound." Writing gags for TV, especially Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows," would also inspire his play "Laughter on the 23rd Floor." </p><p>Many of his biggest Broadway hits, including "Barefoot in the Park," "The Odd Couple," "Last of the Red Hot Lovers," "Sweet Charity," "The Prisoner of Second Avenue," "Plaza Suite," "The Sunshine Boys" and "Chapter Two," would be adapted for films and TV.&nbsp; He also wrote original screenplays, including "After the Fox," "The Heartbreak Kid," "The Out-of-Towners" and "The Goodbye Girl." </p><p>In all, Simon earned four Oscar nominations, won three Tony Awards and a Golden Globe, and received the Pulitzer Prize (for "Lost in Yonkers"). </p><p>Being the toast of Broadway meant something quite personal for Simon. As he told "Sunday Morning," "Many times I would go to the theatre and stand in the back and people would come up and they say, 'How do you know my father?' 'How do you know my cousin?' I seem to have touched that aspect of their lives that's familiar with them as familiar with me … Making a connection with millions of people is pretty good!"</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Rene Perez/AP Photo</p>                    </li>

Born in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Harris was a member of Playwrights Theatre Club (which she joined while still in high school) and the Compass Players, before forming the inaugural lineup of the improvisation group Second City, in 1959.</p><p>"The improvisations were the thing," Harris told the Los Angeles Times.

He was also the first black African to lead the world body, from 1997 to 2006.</p><p>From the outset of his tenure, Annan struggled to restore the U.N.'s tarnished reputation (including notable failures by the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, which he had previously lead). When he departed, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for its 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development. He was chief architect of what became known as the Millennium Development Goals, and played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the U.N.'s first counter-terrorism strategy.</p><p>Despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, Annan was never afraid to speak candidly. That didn't always win him fans, particularly in the case of President George W. Bush's administration, with whom Annan's camp spent much time bickering. Much of his second term was spent at odds with the United States, the U.N.'s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on it to pay almost $2 billion in arrears, at the same time he pushed against the invasion of Iraq. </p><p>Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He returned in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League's special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his eponymous foundation, which in 2007 helped broker peace in Kenya, where election violence had killed over 1,000 people.</p><p>At the end of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, in 2001, Annan reminded the world of the importance of the U.N.: "Beneath the surface of states and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate of individual human beings in need," he said.&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images</p>                    </li>

"Somebody said: 'Here's a Spitfire – fly it, and if you break it, there will be bloody hell to pay,'" he recalled in 2013.</p><p>Serving with 92 Squadron, "Boy" (pictured at RAF Biggin Hill in Kent) was the youngest Spitfire pilot to defend Britain against the Luftwaffe. Surpassing the average four-week life expectancy of RAF pilots during the war, he flew between 50 and 60 sorties during the Battle of Britain, shooting down or damaging several German planes. Wellum was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and was later promoted to flight commander.&nbsp;</p><p>Years later, as he faced divorce and the loss of his house, he told the Independent, "I just wanted to sit quietly and convince myself that at some point in my life I had been of use." Wellum penned a memoir, which would later be published as the bestseller "First Light," hailed as a remarkably emotional tale of a young man coming of age inside the cockpit of a fighter plane. It was later turned into a BBC film, which Wellum himself judged to be the most authentic rendering of the Battle of Britain, surpassing even the 1969 epic "with all the big chaps in it," he told Forces TV.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Cecil Beaton/Imperial War Museums</p>                    </li>

American youths fighting overseas, however, were not into "drab, sterile announcements" with middle-of-the-road music, Cronauer told The Associated Press in 1987. The battle over the airwaves was joined: "I wanted to serve the listeners."</p><p>His military radio antics inspired the character played by Robin Williams in the film "Good Morning, Vietnam," who drops Perry Como and Lawrence Welk from his 6 a.m. playlist in favor of the Dave Clark Five. Cronauer loved the movie but admitted much of it was Hollywood make-believe, explaining, "Yes, I did try to make it sound more like a stateside station. Yes, I did have problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by yelling, 'Good Morning, Vietnam!'"</p><p>The rest was invention on the part of Hollywood scriptwriters and Williams' improvisational genius. "If I did even half the things that Robin did in the movie, I'd still be in Leavenworth!" Cronauer told journalist Rick Fredericksen in 2014.</p><p>After the military, he worked in radio, television and advertising. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania's law school and worked in communications law. He later handled prisoner-of-war issues for the Pentagon. "I always was a bit of an iconoclast, as Robin was in the film," Cronauer told the AP in 1999. A lifelong, card-carrying Republican, he said he was not anti-military or anti-establishment: "I was anti-stupidity. And you certainly do run into a lot of stupidity in the military."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Adrian Cronauer, courtesy of Paul Bottoms; Thanks to AFVNvets.net</p>                    </li>

The shy boy - abandoned by his father and raised by a domineering mother - joined the Coast Guard at 15 by lying about his age. An equestrian and figure skater, he emerged a star in the 1952 potboiler "Island of Desire." Soon after, the handsome, muscular Hunter appeared on a flood of magazine covers, nabbed a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, and won the admiration of millions of teenage girls as the "Sigh Guy." He starred in the films "Battle Cry," "The Burning Hills" (opposite Natalie Wood), "They Came to Cordura" (with Gary Cooper), and "Damn Yankees!" He also topped the Billboard chart in 1957 with his recording of "Young Love"</p><p>Rumors about the actor's homosexuality burned up the scandal sheets, but he continued working under the studio-projected image of him as a teen heartthrob. "I was living a lie, absolutely," he told "Sunday Morning" in 2005. "I was another person. I mean, my sexuality was my sexuality. And it was not what people perceived. You know, people believe what they want to believe. But this was very difficult for me."</p><p>His career ebbed to a short-lived TV show and cheap exploitation flicks ("Ride the Wild Surf"), and small roles in "The Loved One," ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean" and "Grease 2." But in the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, most notably John Waters' 1981 "Polyester" and Paul Bartel's 1985 "Lust in the Dust."</p><p>In his 2005 memoir, "Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star," Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man. "I believed, wholeheartedly - still do - that a person's happiness depends on being true to themselves," he wrote. "The dilemma, of course, was that being true to myself - and I'm talking sexually now - was impossible in 1953."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP Photo</p>                    </li>

Diaz was freelancing for AP in November 1999 when a boater found a Cuban boy floating in an inner tube in the waters off Fort Lauderdale. Diaz spent the next few months chatting with Elian Gonzalez's relatives and neighbors, earning their trust by respecting an order from the boy's uncle to not speak to the child.</p><p>Because of those relationships, he was the only photographer to capture the moment when U.S. immigration agents ended a bitter international custody battle with a pre-dawn raid the day before Easter in 2000. Diaz's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo shows an armed U.S. immigration agent reaching out toward the terrified six-year-old, seconds before the boy was pulled out of his uncle's Little Havana home so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. &nbsp;</p><p>After the picture hit the wires and network news, Diaz saw how both Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Cuban-American community leaders used it to argue that the other side was brutal and heartless. "I have no opinion on it. I shot the moment. That's all," Diaz said last year. "Good or bad, that's what happened that morning."</p><p>During his career Diaz, who was known to roar, "Hello, Miami!" every time he entered the AP's South Florida office, shot World Series games, recovery efforts after 9/11, hurricanes, and, memorably, the magnified eye of an election official trying to make sense of a hanging chad during the disputed 2000 Florida recount.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Alan Diaz, Wilfredo Lee/AP</p>                    </li>

His Peabody Award-winning CNN series "Parts Unknown" showed viewers the one common ingredient to the kaleidoscopic cultures of the Earth: meats, fish, veggies, breads, spices, sauces and alcohol, in all their dizzying combinations.</p><p>But he knew better than other TV chefs that the sensual pleasures of food are often irremovable from the places in which they originated – hence the treks to lands that were exotic (or at least filmed and edited in a smashingly exotic manner), which were gastronomic excuses to sit with families and friends for gossip, local history, <a href="/politics/" data-is-autolink="true">politics</a>, and lore about food.</p><p>His celebrity was born from his 2000 book, "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly," and his early TV series, "A Cook's Tour" (for the Food Network), and the Travel Channel's "No Reservations," which won two Emmys. As a storyteller, both of his own journey through life (overcoming drug addiction and rising to become an executive chef in New York) and about the cultures into which he dipped his toes, Bourdain was unparalleled   – melding ego, curiosity and appetite into one boisterous, entertaining stew.&nbsp;</p><p>In the book "My City, My New York" (2011), Bourdain offered this: "I've often said that cooking is a dominant act, it's an alpha act. But eating should be a submissive act. And chefs are at their happiest when they go to a restaurant and know someone in charge is cooking well. When that happens, I can completely switch over to the other side and experience it washing over me. I know I'm in good hands."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"/Facebook</p>                    </li>

Unlike many Bond Girls who would meet untimely ends during the franchise's 50-year-plus history, Gayson's character actually returned the following year in "From Russia With Love."</p><p>In a 2012 interview with the Daily Record, Gayson explained that she helped Connery overcome nerves on the very first day of production when he kept bumbling his now-iconic opening line. Taking him to lunch and pretending to imbibe, she encouraged him to go off the wagon and loosen up with a drink. He downed two. "Well, not having had a drink for so long, it really affected him, but in a nice sort of way – all his nerves seemed to go out the window," she said. "We went back on set and he said the name 'Bond, James Bond' in a beautiful way."</p><p>Gayson's stage appearances included "Born Yesterday," "No, No Nanette" and "The Sound of Music," and she returned to the London stage in the 1990s in "Into the Woods." She's also remembered for the Hammer horror "The Revenge of Frankenstein," and the TV spy series "The Saint" (starring future Bond Roger Moore), "The Avengers," and "Secret Agent." </p><p>But her place in film history as the very first Bond Girl is assured, though it wasn't without its indignities.

In January 1945, Turgel and her mother were forced onto a death march from Auschwitz to Buchenwald, and later on to Bergen-Belsen in Germany. It was in a hospital at Bergen-Belsen where the 22-year-old Turgel cared for 15-year-old Anne Frank as she lay dying from typhus. "I washed her face, gave her water to drink, and I can still see that face, her hair and how she looked," Turgel told the BBC. One month after Frank's death, the camp was liberated by the Allies.</p><p>After the war, Turgel married one of the death camp's liberators (a British Jew), earning the nickname "The Bride of Belsen." (Her wedding dress, made from parachute silk, is part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London.) In 1987 she published a memoir, "I Light a Candle," and until the end of her life she retold the story of the Holocaust and the horrors of anti-Semitism she witnessed. </p><p>In April she attended Britain's National Holocaust Remembrance Ceremony in London: "My story is the story of one survivor, but it is also the story of six million who perished.

Assigned to oversee the candidate's visit, Tuck – a WWII vet studying under the GI Bill (and who was actually working for Douglas) – hired a large hall and invited a smattering of people, leaving more than 1,900 empty seats. He then quizzed Nixon on the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Though mild by some dirty tricksters' standards, Tuck's decades' long pranks of Nixon were humorous, such as hiring an old woman to console the candidate after his debate against John F. Kennedy with the reassuring, "That's all right, you'll do better next time," or having people in San Francisco's Chinatown hold up a sign in Chinese asking about a questionable loan billionaire Howard Hughes gave to Nixon's brother. Informed of the translation, Nixon ripped up the sign.</p><p>"I never tried to be malicious," Tuck told Time magazine in 1973 of his pranks, from altering the slips of paper inside fortune cookies to embarrass a candidate during a fundraiser, to directing garbage trucks to troll the GOP convention, to hiring pregnant women wearing T-shirts reading, "Nixon's the One." And the wit of his pranks found a reluctant admirer in Nixon himself, who was heard on the White House tapes comparing Tuck's work favorably to his own team's "dirty tricks."</p><p>"I've made a lot of candidates look foolish," Tuck was quoted as saying, "usually with a lot of help from the candidates themselves."&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP</p>                    </li>

His work broke countless rules, but was grounded in old-school, shoe-leather reporting. "Nothing fuels the imagination more than real facts do," Wolfe told the AP in 1999. "As the saying goes, 'You can't make this stuff up.'"</p><p>His book "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" captured the '60s psychedelic culture and his travels with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. His magazine piece, "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's," took a pointed look at fund-raising for the Black Panther Party by Leonard Bernstein and other wealthy whites. Other collections included "The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby," and "The Pump-House Gang." His seminal non-fiction work was "The Right Stuff," his lofty paean to test pilots and Mercury astronauts. </p><p>Asked in 2006 by "Sunday Morning" if he saw himself as a voyeur or a reporter, Wolfe laughed: "I don't think you can separate [the two], but most voyeurs are stupid because they don't get paid for it."</p><p>In the mid-1980s he turned to fiction with "The Bonfire of the Vanities," a sweeping, satirical story about New York City's social inequities, racism, and Wall Street's "Masters of the Universe." First serialized in Rolling Stone, it was published in 1987 and became a critical and commercial blockbuster. Wolfe followed with more fiction, including "A Man in Full," "I Am Charlotte Simmons" and "Back to Blood."</p><p>In 1986 Wolfe suffered a massive heart attack and underwent a quintuple bypass, which both saved his life and changed it. "As the Stoic Epictetus used to say, 'You're nothing but a piece of crockery and a quart of blood,'" he told "<a href="/60-minutes/" data-is-autolink="true">60 Minutes</a>" correspondent Morley Safer in 1988. "And it gives a whole other meaning to the word 'soul.' I think your soul is your relationships with other people. And that's the part of you that really doesn't die."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Jim Cooper/AP</p>                    </li>

Their unforgettable on-screen pairing fostered a strong friendship that lasted for decades, until Reeve's early death in 2004. "When you're strapped to someone hanging from the ceiling for months and months, you get pretty darned close," Kidder told CBS' "The Insider."</p><p>But prior to her star turn as the spunky reporter, Kidder battled manic mood swings – experiences which actually led to her pursuit of acting, and to being cast as troubled teenagers in Canadian TV shows. She starred with Gene Wilder in "Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx," appeared opposite Robert Redford in "The Great Waldo Pepper," and portrayed twins (one a murderess) in the Brian De Palma thriller "Sisters." After her "Superman" breakout, Kidder's films included "The Amityville Horror," "Willie &amp; Phil," "Heartaches," "Some Kind of Hero" and "Trenchcoat."</p><p>But her professional career was hampered by financial problems and depression. Bipolar, she suffered a paranoia-fueled breakdown in 1996 when a computer virus destroyed three years' worth of writing on her laptop that could not be salvaged. She was found after disappearing for four days in the hills of Los Angeles, received help, and would eventually resume acting (and writing). She appeared on the TV series "Smallville," "The L Word," and "La Femme Nikita," and won an Emmy Award for the children's TV series "R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour." </p><p>She also became an outspoken activist; in 2011 she was arrested outside the White House protesting the Keystone pipeline.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> American International Pictures</p>                    </li>

And he said, 'Can you say that again?' And I did, and we did it."</p><p>That first fire, in 1986, led to the popular, long-running counterculture celebration known as Burning Man, held annually the week before Labor Day in Northern Nevada's Black Rock Desert.

In public, Barbara preferred to leave political matters to her husband, George H.W. Bush. But her stand-by-your-man stance <em>was</em> her political statement, soothed over by her warm, matronly, self-mocking charm, which earned her enormous popularity, surpassing her husband's in public opinion polls.</p><p>She expressed no regrets over dropping out of Smith College as a sophomore and foregoing a professional career to get married to the young Navy pilot. They had six children together (including President George W. Bush and Florida Governor Jeb Bush), but suffered a family tragedy when their daughter Robin died at age three of leukemia.</p><p>After George Bush built an oil business in Texas, he ran for Congress, and the family headed to Washington, D.C. - one of 29 moves that Barbara Bush organized during their marriage, including one to Beijing, where he served as U.S. envoy to China. When she became first lady, she would use her position to champion literacy as a remedy for improving society. </p><p>In a 2008 commencement speech at Wellesley College, the former first lady said, "Who knows?

It made me what I am today - available for weekend employment, parties and bar mitzvahs."</p><p>Anderson learned the ropes as a street performer in San Francisco, New Orleans and Austin. His first acting job was on "Cheers" as con man Harry "The Hat" Gittes. "It was basically the character I had developed on the street. That's how I made my living, hustling drinks in bars and quarters on the street."</p><p>Anderson became best known for playing an off-the-wall judge working the night shift of a Manhattan courtroom in the comedy series "Night Court" (1984-1992), earning him three Emmy nominations. After the show ended, he starred in the CBS sitcom "Dave's World" (1993-1997), based on the life of Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist Dave Barry. </p><p>Afterwards, he grew disenchanted with pursing acting roles, moved to New Orleans and opened a magic shop and nightclub, called Oswald's Speakeasy. "I can settle back and do what I want to do, and what I want to do is card tricks and magic," he told People magazine in 2002, a few years before Hurricane Katrina drove him to relocate to North Carolina.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Warner Bros.</p>                    </li>

(In addition to being a dictator, Kim was also a movie fan, and was often credited as executive producer on films made in Pyongyang.)</p><p>Feigning loyalty, Choi and Shin produced nearly two dozen films for Kim, which was good enough to keep them alive, and ultimately to earn them a trip to Austria to attend a film festival in 1986. There, they managed to slip away from their minders and head for the U.S. embassy in Vienna, and freedom. They resettled in America for a time, but work in Hollywood was difficult to come by, and they returned to South Korea, their bizarre odyssey told in the 2016 documentary, "The Lovers and the Despot." As Choi remarked, "There's acting for film, and there's acting for life. And in North Korea, those could be one and the same thing."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Magnolia Pictures</p>                    </li>

"I'm not competition to Pee Wee Herman by any stretch of the imagination. … I do occasionally play sentimental or gentle or emotional characters. It's no problem.

Shore arrived just when a huge stand-up boom was erupting, in no better a place than L.A., after Johnny Carson relocated "The Tonight Show" to the West Coast. Shore became a queen of the comedy scene, with arguably more power than anyone to make or break the career of an up-and-coming comedian.</p><p>Shore essentially lived at the club through the 1970s and '80s [her four children, including comic Pauly Shore, roamed the floor since they were small], and she gave comics gigs, advice, guidance, a clubhouse in which to hang out and talk shop, and occasionally a stairwell in which to sleep. </p><p>Virtually every major comic, from Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Richard Lewis and Jim Carrey to Jerry Seinfeld and Kathy Griffin, used the club (referred to as "a boxing gym for comedy") as a stepping-stone. Many returned to hone their acts after they gained fame.

Hawking was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, when he was a student at Cambridge; doctors believed it would kill him in his early 20s. But despite his condition - confined to a wheelchair, and in later years speaking via a voice synthesizer - he was able to pursue his studies of quantum mechanics, gravity, black holes, and a Unified Theory of Cosmology.</p><p>As slowly as a word per minute, Hawking used the twitching of the muscle under his right eye to grind out his thoughts on a custom-built computer. What he produced was a masterwork of popular science, a guidebook through the esoteric world of anti-particles, quarks, and quantum theory. </p><p>Hawking's other major scientific contribution was to cosmology, the study of the universe's origin and evolution. Working with Jim Hartle of UC, Santa Barbara, Hawking proposed in 1983 that space and time might have no beginning and no end. "Asking what happens before the Big Bang is like asking for a point one mile north of the North Pole," he said.</p><p>Hawking appeared in several documentaries, and played himself (or at least a holographic version of Stephen Hawking) in a 1993 episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." His life was dramatized in the 2014 film "The Theory of Everything," starring Eddie Redmayne.&nbsp;</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> Getty Images</p>                    </li>

Turner would oversee reforms at the agency after the Senate had uncovered CIA surveillance aimed at American citizens and assassination plots against foreign figures, including the hiring of Mafia hit men in a failed bid to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</p><p>Turner (who would be unanimously confirmed by the Senate) promised at his confirmation hearing to conduct intelligence operations "strictly in accordance with the law and American values." He also said "covert operations must be handled very discreetly. People's lives are at stake."</p><p>Turner was the first director given full authority over the agency's $7 billion budget. Assassinations and medical experiments on unwitting human subjects were prohibited, and he dismissed more than 800 officers from the agency. But he also argued that some proposals aimed at sharing agency information with Congress went too far, because of operational sensitivity and the possibility of damaging leaks. </p><p>He also admitted later that the CIA had not fully anticipated the fall of the Shah in Iran or the economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union. "We were just plain asleep," he said.</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> AP</p>                    </li>

The group, which sold more than 40 million records (including the albums "Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?," "No Need to Argue," "To the Faithful Departed," and "Bury the Hatchet"), broke up in 2003, but six years later reunited and began touring again.

"A lot of things made me realize life is very fragile. People die of cancer. There are world-altering events like September 11. You realize that you cannot assume tomorrow is going to come. When you think about things like that, it makes you realize you could be gone tomorrow, so what the heck am I worrying about? It's just a realization, and it came to me in the last couple years. I'm really glad it did because I've just been more relaxed.

After walking the lunar surface, he commanded the maiden voyage of the space shuttle, and oversaw 25 shuttle flights during the program's formative years.</p><p>A relentless advocate for improving flight safety, Young was occasionally a thorn in the side of NASA management, especially in the wake of the 1986 Challenger disaster. Throughout it all, he brought a dry wit, a ready smile, and a cool nerve that belied a near-photographic memory and encyclopedic knowledge of complex space systems.</p><p>Before blasting off aboard the shuttle Columbia on the first flight of the winged orbiter - the first time anyone had launched aboard the untried booster rockets - Young was asked if he had any worries. "Anyone who sits on top of the largest hydrogen-oxygen fueled system in the world, knowing they're going to light the bottom, and doesn't get a little worried, does not fully understand the situation," he famously deadpanned.</p><p>"My life has been long, and it has been interesting. It's also been a lot of fun, and a lot of hard, challenging work," Young once stated. "If I could do it over, I would do it over the very same way. Most of it has been a marvel to me."</p></div>                <p class="credits"><span class="label">Credit:</span> NASA</p>                    </li>

"I came away thinking, 'TV is a piece of cake; I want more of this!'" he later told the Associated Press.</p><p>Van Dyke would make regular appearances on variety showcases like "The Judy Garland Show" and "The Ed Sullivan Show," and starred in one of the most high-concept situation comedies ever: "My Mother the Car," in which his character's deceased mother is reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile. He remarked in 1990 that his brother told him the show sounded promising - this at a time when a show featuring a talking horse was a hit. "I never asked him for advice after that," Jerry added.</p><p>With scores of TV and movie appearances (including "That Girl," "Gomer Pyle: USMC," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Love, American Style," "The Love Boat," "Fantasy Island," and "Fresno"), Van Dyke scored his greatest success with the long-running ABC comedy "Coach," playing assistant coach Luther Van Dam opposite series star Craig T.

<img alt="ATLANTA, GA - MAY 21: Georgia State Rep. Erica Thomas speaks during a protest against recently passed abortion ban bills at the Georgia State Capitol building, on May 21, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia. The Georgia &quot;heartbeat&quot; bill would ban abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Alabama abortion law, signed by Gov. Kay Ivey last week, includes no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, outlawing all abortions except when necessary to prevent serious health problems for the woman. Though women are exempt from criminal and civil liability, the new law punishes doctors for performing an abortion, making the procedure a Class A felony punishable by up to 99 years in prison.

<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">That’s where you get “I fucking love science” type bullshit that’s actually just Neil deGrasse Tyson quotes over photoshopped pictures of space. People think it’s cool to be really into science but they don’t actually enjoy it.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">I’m not saying everyone has to be an expert, but if you’d rather read the reddit comments on an article about CRISPR than meet with Jennifer Doudna to discuss her research, I don’t think you love science as much as you think you do.</p>

<div class="s13uypuv-0 fMQSAJ"><p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">I had this argument in the Serengeti. Granted my friends and I didn't plan on being in Tanzania and since I planned the trip they didn't look into it too much and just trusted me. But we were in Maasai Mara, which is basically an extension of Serengeti but in Kenya. We went to the border and walked into Serengeti. The one girl on our trip wanted to do Maasai Mara and Kilimanjaro. I said that would be difficult on our short trip. Well when our guide told us we were walking into Serengeti she got all upset saying we couldn't be far from Kilimanjaro 🙄. Thanks, Toto.</p></div>

<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">It's even more endearing when they're deaf. My dog was deaf in his last year, he would become so needy and would never leave my side. It was bittersweet to see my once independent Minpin become my shadow.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">But I enjoyed every moment of it and we had a wonderful life together. Trying so hard not to cry after seeing this video and recalling my life with him.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">Edit: It's a rainy day and for the first time in ages I went to watch <a class="rz6fp9-27 fjRVTH" href="https://gfycat.com/GiftedEquatorialBrahmanbull" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this video of him. </a> He loved being in my bed looking out the window. This is one of my favourite memories of us together.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">Edit 2: Thanks for the platinum and I really appreciate it, but please don't glide my comment. Donate to your local animal shelters and put that money to better use.</p>

<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">Actually if I'm not wrong that metal clip on the lower part of the image is a battery housing for a type of button cell, its commonly used on desktop and even laptop PC's for keeping the time and date (and BIOS settings) when they don't have a power source. They are usually referenced as a CR2032 button cell and is about 3V. I can't seem to see the actual battery though, seems missing.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">edit: Sorry I misread OPs comment, likely OP saw the battery receptacle and saw it was empty.</p>
<p class="rz6fp9-10 himKiy">edit2: Yes I have seen the edge of what looks like the battery.</p>

              Trim, peel and halve 2 1/2 pounds medium beets; slice as directed (see left). Place the beets in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and drizzle with 3/4 cup olive oil; season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add cup water and cover with foil. Roast at 425 degrees F, 40 minutes. Uncover and continue roasting, spreading the slices apart and basting with the pan juices halfway through, until the beets are tender, 30 to 40 more minutes. Let cool slightly. Mix 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt with 2 tablespoons each chopped dill and lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Drizzle over the beets and top with crushed pink peppercorns and more dill.

<p>The protesters who were instrumental in bringing about the resignation of Abdelaziz Bouteflika as Algeria's president last month are now threatening to boycott the country's presidential elections.</p>
<p>The demonstrators remain unhappy that allies of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was in power for 20 years, are organising the polls.</p>
<p>On Friday, they held protests and renewed their call for interim President Abdelkader Bensalah and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui to resign.</p>
<p>Dozens of mayors also marched through the capital, Algiers, last weekend in support of the protesters, rejecting moves to go ahead with the presidential elections, which are scheduled to take place on 4 July.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Council has so far received 73 presidential candidate applications, according to the government. </p>
<p>To make it on to the ballot, a candidate has to provide the endorsement of 60,000 voters by 25 May so it is not clear if all 73 applicants will qualify.</p>
<p>Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, a former foreign minister, high-profile human rights lawyer Ali Yahia Abdennour and Rachid Benyelles, a retired general, issued a joint statement over the weekend calling on the military to start a “frank and honest” dialogue with the protesters.</p>
<p>But army chief of staff Gen Ahmed Gaid Salah, the de facto man in charge, was quoted on Monday by a local TV as saying that the electoral timeline had to be respected to avoid a power vacuum.</p>

<p>The Dahomey mothers or Amazons were a group of elite all-female soldiers, who were trained to kill and protect the Kingdom of Dahomey, in modern-day Benin. </p>

<p>They are the fourth story in a new eight-part series, African Women who Changed the World, which aims to shed light on great African women whose stories deserve to be heard.</p>
