<p class="">TRNAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia is dealing with a peculiar kind of apathy.</p>
<p class="">Just 30 years after the Velvet Revolution spelled the end of Communist rule and brought democracy to what later became Slovakia, only around 1 in 8 voters made their voices heard during the last European Parliament election.</p>

<p class="">As around 373 million people across the continent prepare to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/special/european-elections-2019" target="_blank">cast ballots again beginning Thursday</a>, the question of why Slovaks don't bother to exercise that right is a conundrum for some in this landlocked country.</p>
<p class="">“I remember how we lived 20 years ago," Jano Zitnansky, 35, who works in information technology, said. "My family was poor and they're not now — but people have short memories."</p>

<p class="">Peter Martini, 68, a former military driver who was stationed near the border between Austria and what was then Czechoslovakia, agreed.</p>
<p class="">“I appreciate that I get a choice now. Under communism there was only one party,” he said.</p>

<p class="">But since joining the European Union in 2004, Slovakia has consistently had the lowest voter turnout when the bloc elects lawmakers to its Parliament, which shares time among Brussels, Belgium, and Strasbourg, France.</p>
<p class="">Just 13.05 percent voted during the last E.U. elections in 2014. Across the 28-country bloc, the average turnout was 42.61 percent. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/elections-abroad/european-elections/index_en.htm">Voting is compulsory</a> in members Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="">And only 6 percent of Slovaks aged 18 to 24 voted then — compared to 28 percent overall E.U.-wide.</p>

<p class="">“It's horrible, I know, but I'm one of them," said Jakub Švajka, 20, referring to the statistics showing the sheer number of nonvoters while sheltering from the rain at a shopping mall in the capital, Bratislava.</p>

<p class="">Švajka admitted that he didn't care about European politics and didn’t plan to vote this week.</p>

<p class="">It's people like Švajka that E.U. officials are hoping to win over.</p>
<p class="">A nationwide campaign to encourage Slovaks to get out and vote visited 17 towns and cities across the country that's home to around 5.4 million people.</p>

<p class="">“My aim is to double the turnout to around 25 percent,” said Ladislav Miko, the head of the representation of the European Commission in Slovakia. "People laugh, they don’t believe it's possible."</p>

<p class="">But in the small historic city of Trnava, northeast of Bratislava, only a handful of hardy locals braved the unseasonable biting winds to attend a recent event promoting the elections.</p>
<p class="">Most of those who did show up to the "European roadshow" said they had already decided to vote in the Parliament elections — not the event’s target audience.</p>
<p class="">“In Slovakia, people think about, ‘my village, my garden, my home,’ that’s really it. They don’t think about the European elections,” explained Lucia Valentovičová, who was walking with her daughter and sister down a main street and decided not to attend.</p>

<p class="">Some Slovaks complain that the E.U. feels remote and had little impact on their daily lives. Others accused lawmakers of being self-interested and not concerned about problems in Slovakia.</p>
<p class="">Civil servant Jana Čaklošova, 54, is not planning to vote.</p>

<p class="">Candidates and political parties admit the European Parliament elections had traditionally not been a priority here. Locals said the only giveaway an election was happening was a smattering of campaign billboards alongside main roads.</p>
<p class="">“Put simply, politicians and political parties ever since we acceded to the European Union in 2004 have largely tended to ignore this election,” said Vladimír Bilčík, a candidate on the list of a coalition of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/no-policies-no-problem-ukrainian-comedian-s-election-success-latest-n990331" class=" vilynx_listened">President-elect Zuzana Čaputová's Progressive Slovakia party </a>and the Together — Civic Democracy party.</p>
<p class="">“What we’re doing differently this time is, we’re doing a lot of face-to-face campaigning,” he said. “We are trying."</p>

But she was also unhappy about income inequality within the bloc. “We in Slovakia are cheap labor but we’re part of the European Union so I don’t get it,” she said, pointing to the fact that 15 years after Slovakia joined the bloc there remains a wage gap between Western and Central Europe.</span><span class="f2 ls-tight gray-80 ws-tight founders-mono dib">Gabriel Kuchta / for NBC News</span></figcaption></figure>
<p class="">Iveta Radičová, a former prime minister of Slovakia, told NBC News that many voters felt there was little reason to vote in European Parliament elections.</p>

<p class="">“Nothing will change ... what can 13 deputies do in Parliament? Nothing,” she said, highlighting that her country has only a small fraction of the legislature's 751 seats.</p>
<p class="">Radičová said she had been left uninspired by the campaign and said that she will likely not vote.</p>

<p class="">The majority of Slovaks say they feel "very" or "fairly" attached to the European Union, according to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/Chart/getChart/themeKy/26/groupKy/314" target="_blank">European Commission statistics</a>. But on the streets of Bratislava and Trnava, many said they believed that Central and Eastern Europeans were regarded as second-class citizens by people living elsewhere in the bloc. Others expressed complaints about the differences in the standard of living across the E.U.</p>

<p class="">The average gross annual earnings of full-time employees in industry and services in 2011 was 42,900 euros in Germany and 45,793 euros in the Netherlands, compared to 10,788 euros in Slovakia, according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tps00175&amp;language=en" target="_blank">latest available official figures</a>.</p>
<p class="">Others pointed to alleged government corruption as a factor that weighs heavily on Slovakia’s national psyche. The country comes 26 out of 31 European states on a global ranking of perceived levels of public sector corruption, in a report from the Berlin-based charity Transparency International.</p>
<p class="">“Everyone knows if you want some E.U. funds, you have to bribe someone," said fishmonger Patrik Sirotka, explaining why it felt pointless to vote. "It just goes into their pockets,” he added, referring to Slovak lawmakers.</p>
<p class="">The crisis in confidence in Slovak politics reached boiling point last year when investigative journalist Ján Kuciak, who was digging into possible government corruption, was shot dead along with his fiancee, Martina Kušnírová.</p>

<p class="">The murder triggered tens of thousands of people to protest and the subsequent collapse of the Slovak government.</p>

"We just follow the orders from Brussels," she said while traveling by train from Bratislava to Piešťany to visit her father with her son, Matus. “I don’t think Slovaks can affect E.U. policy because we are a small country." Masarykova said the European Union seemed remote from daily life.

<p class="">Many hope Čaputová's victory will propel Slovaks to get out and vote this week. In the country's 2016 parliamentary elections, 59.82 percent of eligible voters turned out, according <a href="http://volby.statistics.sk/nrsr/nrsr2016/en/data01.html">to official figures.</a></p>

<p class="">“What happened after the murder of Ján and Martina is that Slovakia woke up and people started to be more interested in politics,” he said. “They were watching what was happening they were coming into the protests and talking about politics.”</p>
<p class="">The polarized electoral field and rise of the anti-establishment and far-right People's Party Our Slovakia, which some <a href="https://www.politico.eu/2019-european-elections/slovakia/">polls predict could win as much as 12 percent of the vote</a>, may also play a role in boosting interest.</p>

<p class="">CARACAS, Venezuela — Four days after first hearing about an attempted military uprising backed by Venezuela’s opposition leader, Aida Perozo was still waiting to hear details about what exactly had transpired.</p>
<p class="">Perozo, 65, a retired teacher from the city of Maracaibo in northeast Venezuela, has few sources of information. Major social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Periscope were blocked on the day of the uprising by CANTV, Venezuela’s state-run internet and phone company, according to <a href="http://veinteligente.org/#sobreVI">Venezuela Inteligente</a>, a nongovernmental organization that defends digital rights.</p>

<p class="">CNN and the BBC, once available to those with cable television, were also pulled off the air. And decades of media repression have left the country with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2019/01/empty-shelves-shuttered-newsrooms-media-maduro-venezuela-190121072104792.html">few independent journalists</a> and state-run TV.</p>
<p class="">And, one top of that, the power keeps going out.</p>
<p class="">“If it were not for social media, we would not find out about anything,” Perozo said. “Since I don’t have power, in the middle of the night, I use my cellphone with the little battery life it has.”</p>
<p class="">Perozo said she wakes up every day at 3 a.m. local time to check her social media accounts and reply to messages in the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, to which her daughter in Spain sends newscasts recorded on her smartphone. Intermittent blackouts due to government power rationing mean that Perozo often goes many hours with no power or cell service. She said she sleeps with her phone on her pillow.</p>

<p class="">Perozo, like other Venezuelans still in the country, is dealing with the government’s efforts to remain in power and quell uprisings that threaten to remove President Nicolás Maduro. The efforts have included <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/streaming-services-disrupted-in-venezuela-prior-to-guaido-speech-on-national-assembly-blockade-QAd2kRyl">blocking social media and mainstream internet services</a>, messaging apps and news broadcasts.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">The lack of information was most evident April 30, the day of Venezuela’s failed military uprising. That morning, Perozo received a video through WhatsApp at 4 a.m. of opposition leader Juan Guaidó speaking from a military base asking Venezuelans to take to the streets. Perozo quickly realized there was some kind of military uprising some 265 miles away, but her cellphone’s signal dropped shortly after that.</p>
<p class="">In the capital of Caracas, thousands of Venezuelans rushed to the military base to support Guaidó. But outside the capital, where there were more blackouts and weaker cellphone signals, there was little news of what was unfolding.</p>
<p class="">The information drought left many in the country with few details on the uprising. In Maracaibo, people like Perozo took to the streets. Others banged on pots outside their home windows, but had little information beyond Guaidó’s initial announcement.</p>
<p class="">The lack of information added to the challenges Guaidó often faces in reaching the masses, according to Brian Fonseca, director of Florida International University’s Institute for Public Policy.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">“The government is trying to disrupt the planning and coordination among the opposition, stop the ability to inspire masses into the streets, and undermine the ability to communicate the crisis to the international community,” Fonseca said.</p>

<p class="">Venezuela’s efforts to block internet-based communication has resulted in a cat-and-mouse game between the government and its citizens. Around 2014, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/zello-channel-venezuela-maduro/">walkie-talkie app Zello </a>became popular and was often used to communicate during anti-government protests across the country until the government worked to block it. During violent anti-government <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-unrest-death-toll-soars-past-100-protesters-nicolas-maduro/">protests in 2017</a> that left more than 100 dead, <a href="https://ipysvenezuela.org/alerta/venezuela-bloquearon-redes-sociales-una-hora/">social media blackouts</a> were circumvented by some tech-savvy Venezuelans by changing settings on their devices that allowed them to access international Domain Name System (DNS), the equivalent of an internet phonebook that connects URLs with numeric web addresses. Venezuelans also began using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access the internet.</p>
<p class="">Since 2018, many websites have been blocked by the government, leaving Venezuelans to rely on messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram to stay informed.</p>

<p class="">Journalists and media companies have pushed information through the apps. One initiative, called Public Information Service, aims to inform Venezuelans by pushing one-minute audio recordings of the day’s top news through WhatsApp groups. The messages are then forwarded to others in a grassroots effort to keep people informed. News websites have also created Telegram channels to send their top stories.</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">Venezuela’s efforts to curtail the internet add to similar blocks by a growing number of governments around the world that have caused concern among free-speech advocates.</p>
<p class="">“Internet shutdowns are becoming more common around the world as a strategy. Usually, it’s a shutdown in narrow times of emergency,” Danny O’Brien, international director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said.</p>
<p class="">Sri Lanka shut down some social media sites after the Easter Day bombings that left hundreds dead. But blocking the internet is also a way of preventing opposition groups from organizing protests, though that strategy can also backfire.</p>

<p class="">For Venezuelans, the struggle to find information has been years in the making. Under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, much of Venezuela’s independent press has disappeared, with more than 100 media outlets shutting down and state-run TV stations offering little coverage of protests</p>
<p class="">In the more remote Andean region of Venezuela, news is even more scant. In the municipality of Carache in Trujillo state, it has been two months since residents could watch TV because of the power outages. All they have is one state-run radio station. Their cellphone signal is intermittent.</p>
<p class="">Mileidy Andrades, 35, relies on relatives in Caracas to send her messages about what’s happening in the country, but limited information also means she has no way of separating fact from fiction. Misinformation has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/26/688868687/amid-chaos-venezuelans-struggle-to-find-the-truth-online">flourished on the app</a>.</p>
<p class="">“When I finally get a signal, news starts arriving through WhatsApp, but we don’t know if what we see is true because there is no way to confirm,” Andrades said.</p>

<p class="">The day of the uprising, some Venezuelans celebrated what they believed to be the ouster of Maduro, only to find out later in the day that the military uprising had failed.</p>

<p class="">WASHINGTON — North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump agree in their criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday during an exclusive interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>
<p class="">Speaking <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-attends-sumo-match-tokyo-charm-offensive-continues-n1010366" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">from Japan, where she is accompanying the president</a>, Sanders defended Trump for evoking North Korea's criticisms of the Democratic presidential hopeful.</p>

<p class="">And she accused the Obama administration of creating “messes” in places like North Korea that Trump has had to clean up.</p>
<p class="">“I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden,” she said of Trump and Kim.</p>
<p class="">“The president doesn't need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden. He's given his own assessment a number of times. I think you've seen it. I'm sure you've covered it on your program. The president watched him and his administration with President Obama fail for eight years.”</p>
<p class="">She said Trump has "cleaned up a lot of the messes that were left behind. We shouldn't even be in the position that we're in to have to deal with North Korea at the level we are if they had done their job in the first place."</p>

<p class="">"They failed with Iran, they failed with North Korea, they failed on trade," she said, "And we finally have a president that's being tough with these countries. We've put tougher sanctions on North Korea than the Obama administration ever did. But at the same time the president wants to develop that relationship."</p>
<p class="">Biden has come under <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-biden-camps-are-butting-heads-it-s-2020-already-n1007456" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">increasing criticism</a> from the president since he announced his candidacy last month. On Saturday, Trump responded to concerns over recent <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-tests-new-missile-trump-s-resolve-n1002221" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">North Korean missile tests</a>, saying he is confident in his relationship with Kim and seeming to support the foreign leader's criticism of Biden.</p>

<p class="">The North Korean Central News Agency, which is run by the state, has taken an increasingly hostile tone towards Biden in recent days, with rhetoric scaling more hostile as Trump increases his own criticism of his potential 2020 challenger.</p>
<p class="">A report from May 21 pans Biden as “reckless and senseless, seized by ambition for power,” as well as a “fool of low IQ.”</p>

<p class="">Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates responded to both the North Koreans and Trump in a statement from earlier this week, arguing “given Vice President Biden's record of standing up for American values and interests, it’s no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House."</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">“As Vice President Biden said in Philadelphia, Donald Trump 'embraces dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jung Un' while alienating our closest allies. That is antithetical to who we are and it has to change,” Bates said.</p>
<p class="">During her Sunday interview, Sanders echoed the president’s statements about North Korea’s recent weapons tests that came months after a February summit between the two leaders <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-begins-one-one-kim-jong-un-tempering-expectations-n977466" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">ended with no deal</a>.</p>
<p class="">On Saturday, national security adviser John Bolton said that the missile tests were a violation of U.N. resolutions, a statement Trump appeared to downplay in his public tweet.</p>

<p class="">But despite the lack of an agreement to denuclearize the peninsula, Sanders said that good has still come from the attempt to “develop” the relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p class="">“There have been steps that have moved us towards. For a significant period of time there was no missile testing. We got hostages back home to the United States and remains of American war heroes. I don't know how you can say that that's nothing,” she said.</p>
<p class="lastMarkupItem">"To me, that is certainly something. And I know it's something to the families of those individuals who those people came back home.”</p>

<p class="">Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Hasson <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/20/696470366/arrested-coast-guard-officer-planned-mass-terrorist-attack-on-a-scale-rarely-see">spent five years in the Marine Corps</a> and two years in the Army National Guard before entering the Coast Guard. During that time, at his enlistment ceremonies, promotions, and when commissioned as an officer <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html" target="_blank">he undoubtedly swore an oath</a> to <em>“…support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”</em> But Hasson violated that oath. On <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/26/release-approved-for-coast-guard-officer-accused-of-making-hit-list/" target="_blank">Feb. 15, 2019, he was arrested on drug and firearm charges</a> while serving at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="">Soon it was discovered that unauthorized weapons were just the tip of the iceberg. Hasson was also a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/self-proclaimed-white-nationalist-planned-mass-terror-attack-government-says-i-am-dreaming-of-a-way-to-kill-almost-every-last-person-on-earth/2019/02/20/61daf6b8-3544-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f4c6a0e84b62" target="_blank">self-described white nationalist</a>. He was an admirer of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/opinion/new-zealand-tarrant-white-supremacist-terror.html" target="_blank">far-right terrorist Anders Breivik — just like Brenton Tarrant</a>, an Australian white supremacist who has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/21/725390449/accused-shooter-in-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-charged-with-terrorism" target="_blank">been charged with 50 counts of murder</a> for his attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Both had carefully studied <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-manifesto-factbox/factbox-excerpts-from-1500-page-norway-killer-manifesto-idUSTRE76N14J20110724" target="_blank">Breivik’s 1,500-page manifesto</a>, which he had used to justify two attacks that resulted in the death of over 70 Norwegian civilians in 2011.</p>

<p class="">Investigators discovered that over a two-year period Hasson conducted thousands of searches of neo-Nazi and neo-fascist websites on his work computer. He also <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-hasson-coast-guard-pleads-not-guilty-0312-story.html" target="_blank">authored his own manifesto</a> that called for "focused violence" to "establish a white homeland" and created a list of “traitors” he intended to kill, including Democratic politicians, Supreme Court justices, media personalities and social media executives. Alarmed, Hasson’s arrest prompted a group of congressional lawmakers to ask the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security a very serious question: Does the U.S. military have a larger problem with white supremacists?</p>

<p class="">This is a critical question, and one that concerns both active duty military members and veterans. But to understand the current problem, it’s helpful to examine the history of the relationship between the U.S. military and extremism — especially white supremacy. Historically, the American military has not wanted extremists in its ranks, but it has failed to establish a comprehensive way to screen them out. And surveys show that soldiers themselves are noticing significant extremist thinking among their peers. <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/02/28/white-nationalism-remains-a-problem-for-the-military-poll-shows/" target="_blank">Thus, this is not a new problem</a> but rather a long-simmering one that now, for various reasons, may be starting to boil.</p>

<p class="">Radicalization of the kind displayed by Hasson often <a href="https://dworakpeck.usc.edu/news/addressing-the-pathways-toward-violent-extremism-among-military-service-members-and-veterans" target="_blank">depends on several factors</a>: background, beliefs, experiences and peer networks. In this regard, it is important to note that Army and Marine Corps recruits are disproportionately <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/demographics-us-military" target="_blank">drawn from the southeast and northwest</a>, regions that have experienced significant growth in extreme far-right groups. Furthermore, <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/why-cant-the-military-root-out-far-right-extremism-in-its-own-ranks" target="_blank">a 1998 Department of Defense study</a> found that adult leaders of far-right extremist groups encouraged young men and women to enlist in the military to gain access to weapons, military training and other personnel prior to returning to civilian life.</p>

<p class="">The growth in the number and aggressive character of militant far-right groups that boast white nationalist ideologies in the United States over the past decade has made this an even greater concern. The Center of Strategic and International Studies reported that <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/rise-far-right-extremism-united-states">far-right attacks quadrupled</a> between 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p class="">This is further substantiated by the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/murder-and-extremism-in-the-united-states-in-2017">Anti-Defamation League (ADL)</a> and University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database. Both declared that far-right extremists were responsible for the<a href="https://qz.com/1435885/data-shows-more-us-terror-attacks-by-right-wing-and-religious-extremists/"> majority of extremist-related murders between 2008 and 2017</a>.</p>

<p class="">So how does this connect with the military? For one thing, there is a strong historical connection between the rise of far-right nationalism and the American military community. The <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kkk-founded" target="_blank">Ku Klux Klan, founded in 1866</a> by a group of Confederate war veterans, offers perhaps the best example of the symbiosis that can and has existed between extremists and members of the military.</p>
<p class="">The strength of far-right groups waned in the aftermath of World War II, but it did not disappear. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WsULqb6k0BoC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=klu+klux+klan+%22cam+ranh+bay%22+1968&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iHoLIBSttO&amp;sig=ACfU3U1r80EF9fFLbvisEMKylfFPr_niXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwr8nGudrgAhXjxYMKHaIGCQ8Q6AEwC3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=klu%20klux%20klan%20%22cam%20ranh%20bay%22%201968&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Klan members paraded</a> on an American base in Vietnam following the 1968 murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/09/archives/marines-in-klan-openly-abused-blacks-at-pendleton-panel-hears.html" target="_blank">Marines held Klan meetings in 1976</a> at Camp Pendleton. Official attitudes started to change in the mid-1980’s, notes New York Times reporter Dave Phillips, after pictures emerged of uniformed soldiers and a sign: “KKK rally, no Jews allowed.” Still, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crec/1998/10/08/CREC-1998-10-08-pt2-PgE1970.pdf" target="_blank">in 1995, members of the elite 82nd Airborne Division formed a neo-Nazi group</a> at the urging of Robert Hunt, a National Alliance recruiter. In December of that year, two members of the group murdered a black couple. The killers received life imprisonment and 19 soldiers were dishonorably discharged. This, finally, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9602/ft_bragg/index.html" target="_blank">sparked congressional hearings</a> on extremism in the military.</p>
<p class="">But the problem appears to have persisted. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq there has been growing evidence that military members and veterans are once again becoming susceptible to recruitment by such groups. Upon their return from Afghanistan or Iraq many service members have described a feeling of alienation from civilian society. They frequently voice a desire for the sense of belonging, brotherhood, and patriotism which they had in the military or during deployment. Those who leave the military frequently can grow frustrated trying to find employment that might facilitate their reintegration.</p>
<div class="container___1unUn mv8 smallContainer___VvWON mt2-m"><p class="text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond">Upon their return from Afghanistan or Iraq many service members have described a feeling of alienation from civilian society.</p></div>
<p class="">This was further corroborated by a report published by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2006. It showed that a number of military personnel<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2006/several-high-profile-racist-extremists-serve-us-military" target="_blank"> had joined various far-right extremist groups</a> such as the Fourth Reich, Aryan Nation, National Alliance, National Socialist Movement, etc. in the ten years after the Pentagon toughened policies on extremist activities by military members. This was supported by a 2008 FBI assessment.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">A 2009 Department of Homeland Security (HLS) report further warned that the combination of the election of the first African American president, a downturn in the economy, and an influx of unemployed vets returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan were potential flashpoints and that military personnel and veterans were being targeted by far-right extremist groups. But <a href="https://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf" target="_blank">this report created a political firestorm</a> among Republican politicians, conservative commentators and veteran groups. As a result,<a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/why-cant-the-military-root-out-far-right-extremism-in-its-own-ranks" target="_blank"> it was rescinded by Secretary Janet Napolitano</a>, and the Obama administration subsequently did little to address the issue.</p>
<p class="">Ten years later, it is clear that the military still needs to actively combat far-right extremism and white nationalism that threatens to infiltrate its ranks. In 2010, for example, a Marine Corps sniper team in Afghanistan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/09/us-military-marines-nazi-ss-flag-photo" target="_blank">posed for pictures with a Nazi flag</a>, <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/does-the-american-military-have-a-problem-with-far-right-extremism">and there have been additional reports</a> that the KKK and other organizations were, and likely still are, seeking to recruit military veterans.</p>
<section class="embedWidget medium___Qn3DV"><div class="usePresentation___EGHVR"><div class="" data-poll="do-you-think-the-military-should-be-worr" data-customer="think"></div><div></div></div></section>
<p class="">Obviously, the military does not want such recruits, but it also does not have a comprehensive system for screening them out. All recruits go through a criminal-background check when they enlist, but this only detects extremist membership if they have been charged with a crime related to such beliefs. Those who have no associated convictions can slip through. Recruits’ medical records are reviewed for signs of significant mental illness, but there is no formal psychological assessment that might detect extremist views.</p>

<p class="">Furthermore, the military (particularly the active Army, National Guard and Reserve) <a href="https://news.usni.org/2017/10/12/panel-pentagon-facing-future-recruiting-challenge-due-lack-candidates" target="_blank">is finding it increasingly difficult</a> to achieve required goals for recruiting and retention. This discourages both recruiters and even commanders from digging too deep into the background of potential recruits.</p>
<p class="">The vast majority of our military does not support such fringe ideas. But it also is not unaware of the problem. A recent survey conducted by Military Times reported that 22 percent of service personnel had <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/02/28/white-nationalism-remains-a-problem-for-the-military-poll-shows/">seen signs of white nationalism or racist ideology</a> within the armed forces. This was the same as the results from a similar survey conducted in the aftermath of the 2017 clash between white supremacists and counter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

<p class="">Among non-white personnel, incidents of racism and racist ideology increased from 42 percent in 2017 to half of those surveyed in 2018, and 35 percent of troops surveyed saw white nationalism as a significant threat to the country. This was higher than the total number of troops who saw Syria, Afghanistan, or immigration as serious national security concerns, according to the Military Times. Actions to address this issue must begin at the top and will require a more careful consideration of strategy and resources.</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">The Washington-based Stimson Center reported that between 2002 and 2017, <a href="https://www.stimson.org/content/counterterrorism-spending-protecting-america-while-promoting-efficiencies-and-accountability">the U.S. spent $2.8 trillion</a> (15 percent of discretionary spending) on counterterrorism. The primary if not exclusive focus was terrorist attacks posed by Muslim extremists. Disinterest does not stop at the Pentagon alone. The Trump administration's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NSCT.pdf" target="_blank">National Strategy for Counterterrorism 2018 report</a> described the principal terrorist focus as radical Islam but said little about the emergence of far-right nationalism — and nothing about the threat it posed to the U.S. military.</p>

<p class="">The Department of Defense reported to Congress in 2018 that out of 1.8 million Americans serving in the military, only 18 had been disciplined or discharged for extremist activities over the past five years. Consequently, civilian and military leaders suggest investigating the presence of such groups in the military is not a priority. But experts point out that the military has no internal law enforcement task force monitoring extremist networks or generating comprehensive data. There is also limited sharing of intelligence on such groups across federal agencies. As a result, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/military-white-nationalists-extremists.html" target="_blank">one former DOD investigator observed</a>, “…every year they get a report based on what they were never looking for.” Another described the U.S. government’s lack of a concerted effort to gather intelligence on extremist groups as a black hole.</p>

<p class="">Far-right nationalism in the U.S. military and veteran community has a destructive effect on civil-military relations and how the American people view the armed forces. It is corrosive to morale and security among military personnel. Even non-violent activism from soldiers, sailors, airmen, or Marines with extremist views has a negative effect on good order and discipline as well as readiness and cohesion.</p>
<p class="">Of even more concern, of course, is the deadly consequences we know can result from the combination of far-right ideology, access to weapons, training, and the internet. This now seems more worrisome due to the rise of the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-to-hunt-a-lone-wolf-countering-terrorists-who-act-on-their-own/" target="_blank">so-called “lone wolf” domestic terrorist</a>.</p>

Along with one accomplice, he planned and executed the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 19 children. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/how-the-turner-diaries-changed-white-nationalism/500039/" target="_blank">McVeigh was motivated by “The Turner Diaries,” a 1978 novel </a>that depicts violent revolution in the U.S. that serves as a catalyst to triggers government collapse, race war, and the extermination of all non-whites. At his execution, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/mcveigh.usa1">he read the poem “Invictus,”</a> which means “Unconquerable” in Latin, as his final statement. It was a warning the military must heed. McVeigh and those like him today are determined to fulfill their misguided destiny.</p>

<p class="">The <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1037-julian-assange-espionage-act-indictment/426b4e534ab60553ba6c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1">18-count superseding indictment</a> unsealed against Julian Assange by the Justice Department on Thursday tees up a major test case for the relationship between press freedom and the Constitution. Not because Julian Assange is a journalist; he isn’t. And not because the conduct alleged in the indictment, if proven, should be protected by the Constitution; it shouldn’t be. Rather, the reason why the Assange case is so momentous is because it is based at least in part on a theory of criminal liability under the Espionage Act of 1917 that the government has never successfully prosecuted before — and because that theory crosses a constitutional line with regard to the press that the government has previously respected.</p>

<p class="">Enacted in the midst of World War I (and, importantly, before virtually all of the Supreme Court’s modern First Amendment jurisprudence), the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793">Espionage Act</a> controversially made it a crime not only to spy on this country and steal national security secrets, but even simply to receive classified national security information without authorization. The law does not require that an offender intend to harm the United States; it requires only that the defendant know or have “reason to believe” that the wrongfully obtained or disclosed “national defense information” is going to be used to hurt the United States, or help a foreign nation.</p>

<p class="">So when The New York Times or Washington Post publish scoops based upon leaked classified information, technically, they are violating the plain language of the Espionage Act — even if the scoop is revealing an unlawful government program or some other matter of unquestionable public concern. Those journalists responsible for stories revealing the government’s torture of enemy combatants; the CIA’s operation of secret “black sites”; the NSA’s bulk collection of Americans’ phone records; and any number of other critical journalism investigations that were aided by national security leaks over the past 15 years are all punishable under the plain terms of the statute.</p>

<p class="">Worse still, so are their readers — who are in receipt of the unlawfully leaked classified information simply by downloading the article onto their laptop or bringing the physical newspaper into their home. The text of the Espionage Act draws no distinction between the leaker, the recipient of the leak, or the 100th person to redistribute, retransmit, or even retain the national defense information that by that point is already in the public domain. So long as someone knows or has reason to believe that their conduct is unlawful, they are violating the act’s plain language regardless of their specific intent. (This is made even more ridiculous by the fact that, by the time a reader of the Times has brought a newspaper into their home, the proverbial cat is long since out of the bag.)</p>
<p class="">None of this is new. Even when the Supreme Court in the “Pentagon Papers” case famously rejected the government’s effort to prevent the Times and Post from publishing the documents, several of the justices in the majority suggested that those entities could potentially be prosecuted after publishing under the 1917 law. Then, as now, the question was not whether the Espionage Act allows for the prosecution of the press for gathering and disseminating classified national security information; it was whether the First Amendment in any way bars it.</p>
<div class="container___1unUn mv8 smallContainer___VvWON mt2-m"><p class="text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond">In the 102 years that the act has been on the books, the government had never prosecuted a journalist for retaining or publishing classified national security information.</p></div>
<p class="">The reason why this remains an open question today is because the government has never forced the issue. In the 102 years that the act has been on the books, the government had never prosecuted a journalist for retaining or publishing classified national security information. Indeed, it had only tried to <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2500022/united-states-v-rosen/">prosecute a third party under the Espionage Act once</a> — and that case collapsed, at least in part due to First Amendment concerns.</p>

<p class="">Not anymore. Although the new indictment against Assange alleges a series of actions that go well beyond what anyone would define as responsible journalism, those are just factual allegations, not legal theories. 17 of the 18 counts in the indictment allege violations of the Espionage Act — crossing a constitutional Rubicon that the government had never previously sought to ford. Not only do the charges include counts based upon Assange’s receipt and retention of classified information, but they also include a series of counts based upon Assange’s facilitation of leaks by Chelsea Manning — where the line between what Assange did and what the most responsible journalists do when cultivating sources is not as bright as we might like it to be.</p>

<p class="">If Assange is successfully extradited (which is still likely, but has become more complicated by the new indictment), his case would almost certainly rise and fall on the constitutional question — whether his conduct was in any way protected by the First Amendment. Given who Assange is, and given the allegations against him, it’s easy to imagine that courts would say “no.” But as the old adage goes, “hard cases make bad law.” In the process, Assange’s case could set a dangerous precedent with regard to the kinds of activities that the First Amendment does not protect — a precedent that could chill even the most careful, skilled professional journalists from pursuing stories involving national security secrets. That’s why it doesn’t matter whether Julian Assange is a journalist; what matters is that his case could set a legal precedent that applies to folks with far cleaner hands.</p>

<p class="">It’s easy to blame the Justice Department in general, and the Trump administration, in particular, for taking the first step down such a slippery slide. But part of the blame here also lies with Congress, which has, for decades, been warned about a potential future case exactly like this — and has nevertheless chosen to leave the law unchanged. This history of congressional quiescence led a pair of Columbia law professors, <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/library/edgar.pdf">writing in 1973</a> (shortly after the Pentagon Papers case), to conclude that “we have lived since World War I in a state of benign indeterminacy about the rules of law governing defense secrets.” That indeterminacy has only become more pronounced over the ensuing four and a half decades. And as of yesterday, it is no longer benign.</p>

<p class="">Evdokimova is now a social worker who also helps to conduct the census. She says that the majority of the residents of Yakshina are elderly. Most younger people, including her own children, have left in search of work.</p>
<p class="">“There is no future here," she said. "It’s all on the verge of collapse. Soon the whole village will be made up solely of retirees."</p>

<p class="">Evdokimova's husband, Vladimir, is unemployed after losing his job when the local Soviet-era collective farm shut. Perhaps, she reflects, they should also have given up on Yakshina, but her sick parents and livestock now keep her there.</p>
<p class="">Similar bleak scenarios are also playing out in thousands of other villages across Russia.</p>
<p class="">"In some places, life is vanishing, but it at the same time it is concentrating around the large [city] centers,” said Tatyana Nafedova, the co-author of a recent study on rural decline for the Demographics Institute at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics.</p>
<p class="">Nafedova and her co-author, Nikita Mikrtchan, found that around 200,000 people each year leave Russia’s villages to find employment and better living conditions in towns and cities.</p>

<p class="">That would be more than the 282 it won in the last general election in 2014 and more than the 272 seats needed for a majority in India’s Parliament.</p>
<p class="">"Thank you India!" Modi <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1131527111804477440" target="_blank">tweeted </a>Thursday. "The faith placed in our alliance is humbling and gives us strength to work even harder to fulfill people's aspirations."</p>
<p class="">Meanwhile, main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi conceded the loss of his parliamentary seat, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p class="">“I don’t think even in the wildest dreams of BJP leaders they thought they would do this well,” said Sayan Banerjee, a political scientist at the University of Essex who focuses on India and South Asia, cautioning that all the votes were yet to be counted.</p>

<p class="">The vote was seen as a referendum on Modi, whose economic reforms have had mixed results, but whose roots as a social underdog in India’s highly hierarchical society boosted his popularity. The son of a tea seller, Modi was propelled to power in 2014 and has presented himself as a pro-business leader who is strong enough to defend the country against <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistan-conducts-missile-test-says-it-wants-peace-india-n1009121" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">Pakistan, India’s Muslim-majority archrival.</a></p>
<p class="">Despite its reputation as the party for upper classes, in 2014 Modi was able to transform the BJP into the party of the marginalized, K. C. Suri, who teaches political science at the University of Hyderabad, said. "He broke that image, drawing support from the poorer classes," he said, adding that the results would likely show that Modi had achieved this again.</p>
<p class="">The success of the BJP comes off the back of a flare-up of long-standing tensions between nuclear-armed enemies India and Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan-based militants killed dozens of Indian troops in the disputed region of Kashmir. Modi responded by launching airstrikes targeting what New Delhi said were militant training camps in Pakistani territory.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">Going into the polls, India-watchers might have expected the BJP to be penalized for their economic record, according to Katharine Adeney, director of the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute. "Modi was going to get Indians jobs and there are lots and lots of young Indians without jobs," she explained.</p>
<p class="">However, she said, Modi successfully framed this campaign around national security, particularly following the attack in Kashmir. "He brought up national security repeatedly in his speeches, he portrayed himself as the watchman of India and this has been shown to play extremely well with the Indian electorate," she added.</p>
<p class="">Banerjee agreed that the flare-up in Kashmir had helped Modi's campaign. “This definitely turned the tide and projected Modi as a strong leader,” Banerjee said. “It was definitely appreciated by BJP voters who were wavering.”</p>
<p class="">The poor showing by the opposition Congress party will raise questions about the leadership of Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty whose father, grandmother and great-grandfather all served as prime ministers.</p>

<p class="">“Gandhi is seen as runner-up in terms of strength and charisma compared to Narendra Modi,” Banerjee said. “The dominant narrative is that Gandhi is a rich guy from a famous political party … people feel that he doesn’t deserve it and he doesn’t get what the people want.”</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">The other parties presented the fight as one to unseat Modi, Suri said. "Either you were for Modi or opposed to him and I think that favored Modi in the end," he added.</p>
<p class="">As for what a landslide victory for the BJP could mean for India, critics have said Modi’s Hindu-first platform risks exacerbating social tensions in the country where Hindus comprise about 80 percent of the population.</p>
<p class="">"Life could become more uncomfortable for Muslims in terms of rhetoric, relations with neighbors and in terms of civil rights," in some regions of the country, Banerjee said.</p>
<p class="">The dominant socially-conservative wing of the BJP hopes to turn the structure of Indian society from a caste-based hierarchy to a cleavage based on religion, he said. This is because it would help them retain power in the future, he added.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">However, Banerjee cautioned, that vision would be difficult to achieve in a country where the caste structure is deeply rooted.</p>
<p class="">Adeney said Modi's campaign was polarizing and demonized Muslims. She said she was concerned that under the governance of the BJP, India would continue to see attacks on Muslims, particularly regarding the issue of "cow protection." The animals are revered in India so rumors of slaughtering, eating or transporting cows for that purpose can stir deep rage and mobs of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/india-s-supreme-court-tackles-cow-protecting-mob-lynching-n911771" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">so-called cow protectors killed at least 20 people last year. </a></p>
<p class="">Suri said the BJP and the Congress party had different visions of how India should work. The Congress party, he said, could be best understood as promoting a secular, plural and inclusive state based loosely on the Western idea of multiculturalism.</p>
<p class="">However, he said the BJP promoted what he described as “a different imagination” of India where all citizens should be treated equally but at the same time India should be a Hindu nation.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">“The basic ideology of the BJP is to unite Hindus into a strong nation,” Suri said, adding that they believe that whoever lives in India is a Hindu, regardless of religion.</p>

<p class="">LONDON — Boris Johnson is one of the most divisive political figures in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="">He is also favorite among bookmakers and pollsters to become the next leader of the Conservative Party — and therefore the next prime minister — after Theresa May announced Friday that she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-announces-she-will-step-down-n920161" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">would be stepping down June 7</a>.</p>

<p class="">But he's far from a consensus candidate.</p>
<p class="">Thirty two percent of people have a positive opinion about him, according to the pollster YouGov, the highest of any politician in the country. But far more, 46 percent, hold a negative view.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">"He has a polarizing effect," said Scott Lucas, a professor of politics and American studies at England's University of Birmingham. "He's probably the most liked politician but also one of the most disliked as well."</p>
<figure class="medium___16lj6"><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><figcaption class="caption___fMPAB f3 lh-copy grey-100 publico-txt caption___1mNth mt4"><span class="mr3">Former London Mayor Boris Johnson dangles from a zipwire in London's Victoria Park on Aug. 1, 2012 in London, England.</span><span class="f2 ls-tight gray-80 ws-tight founders-mono dib">Rebecca Denton / Getty Images file</span></figcaption></figure>
<p class="">Critics accuse Johnson of being an arch opportunist. In the past, he has argued for tax cuts and against rises in welfare spending, and in the House of Commons he has voted generally in favor of equal gay rights, according to They Work For You, a website that tracks lawmakers' decisions.</p>
<p class="">However, there are still big questions about what his government would actually look like, including its relationship with the United States.</p>
<p class="">In 2015, when President Donald Trump said parts of London had been "radicalized," American-born Johnson, who was the city's mayor at the time, replied that the president's "ill-informed comments are complete and utter nonsense."</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">He added, "Crime has been falling steadily in both London and New York. And the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump."</p>
<p class="">Fast forward to last year, and the two were exchanging pleasantries, with Johnson saying there were many reasons for "admiring Trump" and the president declaring Johnson is "a friend of mine" and backing him to be the next prime minister.</p>
<p class="">There were also reports he had been<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lesterfeder/boris-johnson-steve-bannon" target="_blank"> talking privately</a> with Trump's former senior adviser, Steve Bannon.</p>

<p class="">Johnson will face competition for leader. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, are among those to have confirmed they will run.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">In the United Kingdom, choosing a new prime minister does not necessarily require a general election. If the leader of the largest party changes between elections, that person usually becomes the new prime minister automatically.</p>
<p class="">This happened when Cameron resigned in 2016 and May succeeded him unopposed.</p>

<p class="">Johnson would likely face a sterner test, with perhaps more than a dozen potential hopefuls lining up against him. Conservative lawmakers would winnow down this long list to a runoff of two, and the winner would be chosen by the 124,000-odd party members.</p>
<p class="">In any potential matchup, Johnson is the members' favorite "by huge margins," according to a YouGov poll earlier this month. But whoever wins will inherit a Conservative Party in disarray.</p>

<p class="">Its lawmakers are engaged in a civil war over Brexit and the party was polling as low as 7 percent ahead of European Parliament elections which took place in the U.K. on Thursday.</p>
<p class="">Even those who dislike Johnson's disheveled style may see him as their best chance of defeating populists on both the left and right, such as Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.</p>

<p class="">Johnson — full name Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson — is among that rare club of politicians instantly recognizable by one name only — "Boris."</p>
<p class="">Born in New York's Upper East Side, he held U.S. citizenship until 2006. He was educated at Eton — Britain's most prestigious private school — and Oxford University, before starting a career in journalism in the 1980s.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">But he was soon fired by The Times of London for making up a quote. He later joined the Daily Telegraph as a Brussels correspondent, which still pays him £275,000 per year on top of his lawmaker's salary for a weekly opinion column.</p>
<p class="">Johnson is known for causing outrage with quips and turns of phrase that have been described as racist. In 2016, he called President Barack Obama "part-Kenyan" and suggested he had an "ancestral dislike of the British empire."</p>
<p class="">In 2002, he said that Queen Elizabeth II probably enjoyed touring the Commonwealth because of the "cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies." He wrote that Tony Blair, then prime minister, would be met with "watermelon smiles" when he toured the Congo. He has also described Muslim women wearing the burqa as "letter boxes."</p>
<p class="">In 2008, he was elected mayor of London and he served for eight years. He announced himself to the world in August that year, waving a giant flag at the Beijing Olympics to promote London's hosting of the Games four years later.</p>

<p class="">Never shy of a photo opportunity, during the London 2012 Olympics, Johnson was pictured dangling helplessly from a zipwire waving a Union Jack flag. "This is great fun but it needs to go faster," he told the assembled reporters.</p>

<p class="">"He isn't a typical British politician," Lucas at the University of Birmingham said. "He has always played up the idea that he is this really smart guy, but also a bit of a bumbler."</p>
<p class="">Brexit has left Johnson particularly reviled by pro-E.U. "Remainers," not least because of his campaign's discredited mantra that Britain sends £350 million to the E.U. each week.</p>

<p class="">The Trump administration on Friday cited a national security "emergency" allegedly caused by Iran to bypass Congress and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/senate-dem-warns-trump-could-push-through-saudi-bomb-deal-n1009081" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">rush through arms sales worth</a> billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia and other Middle East allies, in a move that drew condemnation from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p class="">Citing a rarely used provision of arms control law, the administration informed lawmakers it was declaring a national security emergency, allowing it to go ahead with the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval, according to administration letters sent to senators and obtained by NBC News.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<div id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></div>
<p class="">"I have determined that an emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national security interest of the United States, and, thus, waives the congressional review requirements," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a letter to Sen. James Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p class="">The decision affected various arms packages worth roughly $8 billion, including deals for precision-guided bombs and related gear for Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to the documents and congressional aides.</p>
<p class="">The two countries are staunch U.S. allies that support President Donald Trump's policies on Iran and have been waging a war since 2015 in support of the Yemeni government against Houthi rebels backed by Tehran.</p>
<p class="">The move came despite growing bipartisan opposition to any arms sales to Saudi Arabia amid outrage over the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-ordered-killing-n937476" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi</a> at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year, as well as over Riyadh's air war in Yemen that has caused high numbers of civilian casualties.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">A bipartisan majority in Congress has voted to halt U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen but President Donald Trump vetoed the legislation last month.</p>
<p class="">A memo accompanied Pompeo's letters justifying the declaration of the emergency due to Iran's actions, including its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen fighting the Saudi-led coalition.</p>
<p class="">"Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at home and abroad," the memo states. "Current threat reporting indicates Iran engages in preparations for further malign activities throughout the Middle East region, including potential targeting of U.S. and allied military forces in the region."</p>
<p class="">Iran has accused the U.S. of trying to provoke a war and denied any role in recent attacks on ships near the coast of the UAE or on a pipeline in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">Pompeo said in a statement that delaying the arms shipments, which included bombs, parts for fighter jets and other hardware, could cause problems for allied aircraft and call into question U.S. reliability in providing equipment.</p>
<p class="">"The United States is, and must remain, a reliable security partner to our allies and partners around the world," Pompeo said.</p>
<p class="">But the secretary of state said the decision to bypass Congress was a “a one-time event” and that the administration would uphold the long-established process for congressional review of proposed arms sales.</p>
<p class="">Democrats in Congress said the Trump administration expedited the arms packages because it could not secure a majority of lawmakers to support any proposed sales to the Saudis.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">"President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove of this sale. There is no new 'emergency' reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there," Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a statement.</p>
<p class="">Some Republicans also denounced the White House for circumventing Congress to complete the sale.</p>
<p class="">“I understand the administration’s frustration that key members of Congress held these arms sales for an extended period of time, in some cases for over a year," said Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="">"However, the President’s decision to use an emergency waiver on these sales is unfortunate and will damage certain future congressional interactions."</p>

<p class="">Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called on the administration to reconsider the decision.</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">"I strongly urge the administration to reverse course from bypassing congressional oversight on arms sales to Saudi Arabia," Young said.</p>
<p class="">"Iran remains the world's largest state sponsor of terror but the current threats that have been briefed to members of Congress do not justify taking this dramatic step. "</p>

<p class="">Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned whether the decision was legal and accused the Trump administration of flouting congressional authority while granting favors to Gulf governments accused of human rights abuses and alleged indiscriminate bombing in Yemen.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">"I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Trump Administration has failed once again to prioritize our long term national security interests or stand up for human rights, and instead is granting favors to authoritarian countries like Saudi Arabia," Menendez said in a statement.</p>
<p class="">He said "the Trump administration decided to do an end run around the Congress and possibly the law."</p>
<p class="">Menendez had held up the sale of tens of thousands of precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a year, due to concerns about civilian deaths from Saudi-led airstrikes, the killing of Khashoggi and alleged rights abuses linked to the UAE in the war in Yemen.</p>
<p class="">Rights advocates and humanitarian groups also condemned the decision.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">"The Trump Administration is manufacturing an emergency to push through the sale of deadly weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates," Scott Paul of Oxfam America said. "The real emergency is the 12 million people at risk of famine in Yemen and the largest-ever recorded cholera outbreak continues to spread because of the conflict, but this administration shows little concern for the millions who suffer."</p>
<p class="">Apart from precision-guided munitions or so-called "smart bombs," the arms sales for Saudi Arabia include mortar bombs, engines and maintenance support for F-15 fighter jets and logistical services for the Saudi air force, according to documents sent to Congress from the administration.</p>
<p class="">The arms packages for the United Arab Emirates cover precision-guided bombs, equipment for AH-64 helicopters, laser-guided rockets, javelin anti-tank missiles, .50 caliber semi-automatic rifles, Patriot missiles, F-16 fighter jet engine parts and U.S. Marine Corps training of the country’s presidential guard. The weapons sale for Jordan involved a transfer of Paveway precision-guided bombs from the Emirates.</p>
<p class="">Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">The Trump administration has refrained from public criticism of the Saudi-led coalition's campaign in Yemen and has focused on Iran's support of Houthi rebels in the conflict, accusing Tehran of fueling the war.</p>
<p class="">But some experts and former officials say the war in Yemen benefits Iran and Al Qaeda-linked militants and that the U.S. needs to use its influence with the Saudis to bring an end to the fighting.</p>
<p class="">"The longer the civil war in Yemen continues, the more opportunity Tehran will have to undermine the interests of the U.S. and our security partners," said Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p class="">"It is in U.S. national security interests to end the civil war in Yemen and address the horrible humanitarian crisis there — both of which are pushing the Houthis deeper into the welcoming arms of Tehran."</p>

<p class="">Menendez and other lawmakers said they would look at a possible legislative response to the Trump administration's decision. Two Democratic congressional aides said senators were discussing legislation that would possibly bar future arms sales to Saudi Arabia without congressional approval.</p>
<p class="">The White House move could trigger a backlash in Congress that would jeopardize future arms sales, Bowman said.</p>
<p class="">"An administration end-run around Congress to complete arms sales to Riyadh risks inciting a congressional reaction that will undermine the administration's broader goals related to its conventional arms transfer policy," he said.</p>
<p class="">Under U.S. arms control law, Congress must be given 30 days to approve U.S. arms sales to foreign countries. However, in a rarely used provision of that law, the president can declare an "emergency," sidestepping Congress and sending the sale through immediately.</p>

<p class="">For years, the rich, white and powerful have demonized marijuana and those who smoke it, eat it or dribble CBD oil in their tea. They labeled it a “gateway drug”; limited research into its medicinal uses; designed and implemented policies that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white">over-criminalized its possession</a> (88 percent of marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010 were for possession, and marijuana represented 46 percent of all drug arrests in the United States); and disproportionately targeted black and brown people for arrest. Ronald Reagan<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxHBx6H-xFo"> fear mongered in 1980</a> that “marijuana — pot, grass, whatever you want to call it — is probably the most dangerous drug in the United States.” Now-former Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="http://www.drugcaucus.senate.gov/content/department-justice-adequately-protecting-public-impact-state-recreational-marijuana">said as recently as 2016</a> that “good people don't smoke marijuana.”</p>
<p class="">But these days, the rich white elite are planning to wildly capitalize on the psychoactive plant. (And I’m not just talking about former Republican House Speaker John Boehner, who <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2011/09/15/oh-the-irony-speaker-of-the-house-john-boehner-continues-to-support-marijuana-prohibition/">declared himself</a> “unalterably opposed” to legalization in 2011 only to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/politics/boehner-cannabis-marijuana.html"> join the board of a marijuana company</a> in 2018.)</p>

<p class="">“If cannabis is ever passed in Texas, chances are good that grocery stores will be selling that too,” Whole Foods CEO, John Mackey <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/chances-are-good-that-whole-foods-will-sell-marijuana-products-ceo-says/">said</a> during a conversation hosted by The Texas Tribune recently.</p>

<p class="">Well, before that happens — before Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and all manner of opulent, upscale grocers start selling pot brownies to their deep-pocketed patrons — every non-violent marijuana-related conviction should be expunged, and those still incarcerated for marijuana crimes should be immediately released. Before a single Wall Street-loving yacht owner makes another dollar off a demonized plant with long-known medicinal properties, every single person who was thrown into the criminal justice system for enjoying it should get their lives back as much as possible.</p>
<p class="">It’s the black, brown and Native American people who still suffer from arrests (despite <a href="https://www.philly.com/philly/news/weed-marijuana-legalization-arrests-pennsylvania-new-jersey-african-american-20181004.html-2">decriminalization</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2017/09/25/trump-administration-makes-it-harder-to-track-marijuana-arrests-but-i-did-it-anyway/#3491610268bc">even legalization</a>) and arrest records tied to the possession of the very same product which this entitled gaggle of money grubbers are slated <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/marijuana-industry-could-be-worth-50-billion-annually-by-2026-2017-04-20">to make billions off of over the next 10 to 20 years</a>.</p>

<p class="">In the meantime, rich white people are raking it in.</p>
<p class="">Even universities are getting in on the action: Northern Michigan University, for example, offers a four-year degree in marijuana. “We’re providing a fast track to get into the industry,” Brandon Canfield, a chemistry professor at the school, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/northern-michigan-university-is-now-offering-a-degree-in-marijuana-2019-03-04">said</a>.</p>

<p class="">But for whom? Usually not those doing time for possession of marijuana. Here’s an idea, though: Offer free tuition at Northern Michigan University (and all universities with marijuana majors and minors) for those who have been savagely ripped from their families and friends and had their lives damaged by the criminal justice system simply because they were black, brown or Native and had pot on their person.</p>
<p class="">It can only help, given how white the entire industry is shaping up to be. “Legal marijuana is an overwhelmingly white industry whose promises on racial equity have been left unfulfilled,” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/02/22/marijuana-legalization-exposes-cannabis-industry-racial-injustice-incarceration-minorities-column/2836449002/" class=" vilynx_listened">wrote</a> in a piece for USA Today.</p>

<p class="">She added: “As case in point, people of color made up to 86 percent of marijuana arrests in New York in 2017. These figures stand in stark contrast to estimates suggesting that those who hold licenses today in this growing industry are roughly 99 percent white.”</p>

<p class="">You can see not dissimilar inequities play out among consumers, too. Here in Denver, Colorado, though recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012, it’s not uncommon to see black and Latinos and Natives hide their joints and edibles while white folks openly puff and pass.</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">The policy nexus of pot and people of color is now a popular Democratic talking point as we near 2020. Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/elizabeth-warren-talks-marijuana-in-new-hampshire-presidential-campaign-stop/">Elizabeth Warren</a> and several of the other nine POTUS-hopefuls are calling for the legalization of marijuana and speak to the scourge of racism in policing when it comes to cannabis.</p>
<p class="">“The War on Drugs has not been a war on drugs, it’s been a war on people, and disproportionately people of color and low-income individuals,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/5/18250374/marijuana-legalization-2020-president-campaign">Booker said</a> this week.</p>

<p class="">And speaking on a radio show on Monday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/04/bernie-sanders-marijuana-reparations-1201388">Sanders said</a> too many people have been unfairly ensnared by this country’s pot policies. “Too many lives are being destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people get criminal records. You know why? Because they have smoked marijuana,” he said. “That’s insane.”</p>

<p class="">Insane, indeed — which is why it makes sense that, as Clarke put it, “those impacted should be given first-in-line access to licensing and job opportunities in this booming industry.”</p>
<p class="">One more suggestion: For every pot brownie or vegan cannabis cookie Whole Foods will inevitably sell, the mega company should vow to pay a portion of the legal fees to help free a person who is in a cage right now simply for having once had weed, the product they want to get in on. It’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="lastMarkupItem">Also, they should just lower their prices. Goodness knows they’ll be the most expensive option around because, let’s be honest here, they already are for everything else.</p>

<p class="">LONDON — When Theresa May became prime minister, she was hailed as a woman who could get things done. On Friday, she <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-announces-she-will-step-down-n920161" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">announced her resignation</a> as one of the least popular British leaders of modern times.</p>
<p class="">Tasked to deliver the most important and divisive change in Britain since the World War II, she instead oversaw a two-and-a-half-year premiership marked by division, infighting and Brexit uncertainty.</p>

<p class="">Formerly home secretary, in charge of domestic security policy and policing, May replaced David Cameron in June 2016, eventually standing unopposed in her party's leadership election after her rivals dropped out.</p>
<p class="">Cameron became the first political casualty of the shock Brexit referendum when he announced his intention to quit just hours after the result came out. Both leaders staked their reputations on Brexit and lost.</p>

<p class="">At first, May was hailed as a steely leader when she took power. A year earlier, in 2015, her party won an outright majority in House of Commons after working in a coalition government for the previous five years. The majority was small, but it seemed like enough to pass the monster Brexit legislation on the horizon.</p>

<p class="">Although May supported remaining in the E.U. during the referendum campaign, she pitched herself as a leader who could bring together the Conservative Party and unite a badly divided country.</p>
<p class="">In those tasks she failed. The country appears even more bitterly divided on the question of its membership of the E.U. as it was at the time of the referendum.</p>
<p class="">European Parliament elections took place in the United Kingdom on Thursday — the result isn't due until Sunday. The Conservatives are expected to get as little as 7 percent of the national vote share, as Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party attracts disaffected Euroskeptic voters.</p>
<p class="">“It was assumed she would be a safe pair of hands, but she’s proved in fact to be remarkably clumsy,” said John Roberts, a U.K.-based senior fellow with the Atlantic Council think tank.</p>

<p class="">It all started going wrong for May in June 2017. Although an election had not been due until 2020, May took a gamble and called a surprise early election, seeking to bolster her strength ahead of what promised to be complex Brexit negotiations.</p>
<p class="">But instead of winning an increased majority, her party lost seats and was forced to rely on the small Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party in a coalition government.</p>

<p class="">It was not a marriage made in heaven. With only 10 seats at the time, the DUP received $1.26 billion for Northern Irish infrastructure and health projects in return for their support, a figure derided by opposition members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="">Negotiations with the E.U on the Brexit agreement dragged on — and when she finally brought the deal home from Brussels and presented it to lawmakers, they said "no thanks." In three votes, members of Parliament, including more than a third from her own party and her DUP coalition partners, rejected the deal by historic margins.</p>

<p class="">“The problem was that she didn’t start counting on day one, and only did when she suffered horrendous defeat. Everything that she’s done since has been too little too late,” Roberts said.</p>
<p class="">A public that once warmed to May as a no-nonsense, trusted manager found it hard to love a politician whose repetitive, monotonous soundbites had become overused to the point of parody. She said the phrase "strong and stable" at least 57 times during the 2017 general election campaign. Tabloid newspapers and Twitter jokers started calling her "the Maybot."</p>
<a href="/news/world/how-theresa-may-became-latest-prime-minister-be-beaten-brexit-n1009191#anchor-Mayslegacy" id="anchor-Mayslegacy" class="scrollLink vilynx_disable"><h2 class="">May's legacy</h2></a>
<p class="">Her goal was to create stability and certainty for the U.K. but May leaves Downing Street with the public no closer to knowing what the outcome of the Brexit saga will be. Her successor — likely to be from the Euroskeptic right of the party — may favor a "no deal" Brexit in which the U.K. leaves the E.U. with minimal international agreements and trading partnerships.</p>
<p class="">And while politicians from across the Commons praised her drive and commitment Friday, observers worry that whatever happens the country's standing in the world is now diminished.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, said: "She is one of the worst — if not the worst — prime minister this country has ever had. She had an opportunity which she grabbed. She’s an ambitious woman. But she’s gotten nothing done on the domestic front. She’s managed to humiliate the country in Europe and beyond, and managed to make a divisive situation worse than it needed to be."</p>
<p class="">But there is sympathy too for a leader placed into what many saw as an impossible situation. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a frequent May critic, said that "her extremely difficult job was made impossible by the Brexit extremists within the Conservative Party."</p>
<section class="embedWidget twitter___ilAzt medium___Qn3DV"><div class="usePresentation___EGHVR"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-twitter-extracted-i1558898568239295496="true"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Theresa May's job was made impossible by Brexit extremists in the Conservative Party.

<p class="">Ruth Davidson, the Conservative leader in Scotland, said: “As Britain’s second female prime minister, she has been a role model for girls and women across the United Kingdom, showing that there is no glass ceiling to their ambitions."</p>
<p class="">May is not the first prime minister to be brought down by the question of the U.K.’s place in Europe — and recent history suggests she won’t be the last. As she announced her departure Friday, May added that her successor would have to find a consensus in Parliament for a Brexit deal. They would, she added, have to compromise.</p>

<p class="">President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. is sending 1,500 more troops to beef up American forces in the region.</p>

<p class="">“The U.S. move to increase its military presence in our region is highly dangerous and a threat against international peace and security,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state news agency IRNA.</p>
<p class="">The new deployment will consist of surveillance aircraft, a fighter jet squadron and engineers to fortify buildings and other facilities. The military is also extending the deployment of a 600-person Patriot missile battalion in the region, defense officials said.</p>
<p class="">All told, the military is sending fewer than 1,000 more troops to the region, officials said.</p>
<p class="">"We want to have protection," Trump said. "We're going to be sending a relatively small number of troops, mostly protective."</p>

<p class="">A proposal involving a surge in troops as high as 10,000 had been circulating in media reports over the past couple of days. But the plan outlined by defense officials Friday is far more modest.</p>
<p class="">"The additional deployment to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility is a prudent defensive measure and intended to reduce the possibility of future hostilities," acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said.</p>

<p class="">Shanahan added that sending the military assets to the region will "improve our force protection and safeguard U.S. forces given the ongoing threat posed by Iranian forces, including the (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) and its proxies."</p>
<div></div>
<p class="">In a Friday briefing, acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Katie Wheelbarger stressed that the U.S. is sending the additional forces in an effort to avert hostilities with Iran.</p>
<p class="">"We do not see these forces as provocative," Wheelbarger said. "We think they are intended to avoid conflict and defend our forces.”</p>
<p class="">The effort to beef up American forces in the region comes amid a period of heightened tensions with Iran.</p>

<p class="">The Trump administration announced earlier this month that it was sending a carrier strike group and Air Force bombers to the Middle East to send a "clear and unmistakable message" to Iran. A day later, four oil tankers were attacked in the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p class="">"We believe with a high degree of confidence that this stems back to the leadership of Iran at the highest levels," Director of the Joint Staff Rear Adm. Michael Gilday said.</p>
<p class="">Gilday added that the U.S. moved to increase its military presence in the region in response to "multiple, credible reports that Iranian proxy groups intend to attack U.S. personnel in the Middle East."</p>
<p class="lastMarkupItem">Some U.S. allies and members of Congress have, however, expressed skepticism over the Trump administration's claims that Iran is responsible for the escalating tensions.</p>

<p class="">Libya's latest upheaval comes at the hands of a mustachioed military strongman who lived in the U.S. for 20 years, has past links with the CIA, and recently spoke on the phone with President Donald Trump about their "shared vision" for the country.</p>
<p class="">The North African nation has been divided, lawless and verging on becoming a failed state ever since NATO intervention, including American airstrikes, helped topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</p>

<p class="">Two rival governments continue to claim power in a country destabilized by warring militias and Islamist fighters.</p>
<p class="">Amid this chaos, experienced warlord Khalifa Haftar earlier this month launched an offensive on the capital, Tripoli, where the internationally recognized government is based.</p>

<p class="">It is the latest development in a bewilderingly complex crisis, where several groups are vying for control but with little sign of resolution.</p>
<p class="">"A morally bankrupt elite is engaged in a zero-sum game for absolute power," said Tarek Megerisi, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p class="">Three weeks ago, Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army launched its offensive on Tripoli. However, what appeared to be an attempt at a swift power grab has since descended into bloody street fighting, with hundreds of people killed and 35,000 forced to flee their homes.</p>
<p class="">Four United Nations agencies have launched a rapid emergency response to try to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p class="">"Instead of pushing into Tripoli with a small force, followed by anticipated side-switching to his side, Haftar has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in Libya's capital," said Inga Kristina Trauthig, a research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London.</p>

<p class="">The capital is currently held by the Government of National Accord, which is backed by the U.N. and, officially at least, the U.S. as well.</p>
<p class="">The U.S. has temporarily withdrawn some of its forces, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-pulls-troops-fighting-engulfs-libya-n991926" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">who are based in Libya</a> helping local troops combat the Islamic State group and al Qaeda militants, as well as protecting diplomatic facilities.</p>
<p class="">The battle for Tripoli has descended into grinding, house-to-house fighting, with both sides gaining and losing territory in different areas along the front line.</p>

<p class="">The commander was a cadet in Gadhafi's 1969 coup that deposed King Idris al-Sanusi.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">The dictator made him a commanding officer in the 1980s, but Haftar soon turned against his own leader, calling for a coup and eventually having to be rescued by the CIA.</p>
<p class="">He lived in Virginia for 20 years, where, according to experts, his proximity to Langley suggested a continued relationship with the CIA. He gained U.S. citizenship before returning to his homeland just before Gadhafi fell in 2011.</p>
<p class="">The general "has fought with and against nearly every significant faction in the country's conflicts," according to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/unravelling" target="_blank">a detailed New Yorker profile of him</a> in 2015. This has given him "a reputation for unrivaled military experience and for a highly flexible sense of personal allegiance," it said.</p>

<p class="">Today, Haftar is allied with Libya's rival Parliament in the eastern city of Tobruk.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">This administration is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and reportedly Saudi Arabia. It does not recognize the Tripoli government, which was formed by a political agreement in 2015.</p>
<p class="">Haftar remains a controversial figure, with many fearing he would become a second Gadhafi. Perhaps outlining his vision for the future, the general said last year that after four decades of dictatorship Libya may not be ready for democracy.</p>
<p class="">"Haftar has an authoritarian agenda and military understanding of politics," Trauthig said. "He has perpetually disregarded the rule of law and refused to subordinate himself entirely to a political authority."</p>
<a href="/news/world/who-khalifa-hafta-whose-forces-are-attacking-tripoli-libya-n999421#anchor-Whyisthishappeningnow" id="anchor-Whyisthishappeningnow" class="scrollLink vilynx_disable"><h2 class="">Why is this happening now?</h2></a>
<p class="">Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa. It is also a jumping-off point for thousands of migrants making the deadly journey across the Mediterranean Sea and into Europe.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">The timing of Haftar's offensive does not seem coincidental. It came while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Tripoli to prepare for a national reconciliation conference that aimed to bring together Libya's rival groups.</p>
<figure class="medium___16lj6"><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div><figcaption class="caption___fMPAB f3 lh-copy grey-100 publico-txt caption___1mNth mt4"><span class="mr3">Fighters loyal to the internationally recognized Government of National Accord get into position during clashes with Khalifa Haftar's forces last week.</span><span class="f2 ls-tight gray-80 ws-tight founders-mono dib">Mahmud Turkia / AFP - Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>
<p class="">Guterres' aides thought Haftar supported the efforts, but the general's push toward the capital appears timed at undermining the process, according to experts.</p>
<p class="">The commander often says he seeks to eradicate Islamist extremist militias in Tripoli and elsewhere, but his detractors say his record on actually cracking down on these elements is patchy at best.</p>

<p class="">These critics fear he seeks to impose a strongman-style leadership in the mold of Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He also appears close to Russia, with one of his high-ranking aides showing up at an international security conference in Moscow last week.</p>
<p class="">These international backers risk turning Libya into another proxy war on the scale of Syria, according to Megerisi, at the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p class="">"One simple takeaway from the current situation is that this is bigger than just Libya," he said. "The resulting chaos from Haftar's escapades has now attracted opportunistic attention from Moscow and President Trump."</p>
<p class="">After the fallout of the 2011 Arab Spring, Haftar has been able to push the "message that Arab states are better off under the boot of a strongman," Megerisi added.</p>

<p class="">Washington's official position had been to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, but a phone call between Trump and Haftar two weeks ago raised serious questions.</p>
<p class="">Trump referred to the renegade general as "field marshal" and praised his "significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources," according to a White House statement.</p>
<p class="lastMarkupItem">"The two discussed a shared vision for Libya’s transition to a stable, democratic political system," it said.</p>

<p class="">People who have contracted Ebola are opting to die at home rather than seek treatment as conspiracy theories fuel distrust of the government and of health workers grappling with the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the workers and aid groups.</p>
<p class="">Nearly 20 new cases of the deadly illness are being identified daily in two northeast provinces of the country. Both areas are opposition strongholds where political tensions run high.</p>

<p class="">In addition to combating a lethal virus, health workers are having to dispel rumors that the disease is manufactured and that the millions of dollars spent on the response are part of a money-making scheme derisively referred to as the “Ebola business.”</p>
<p class="">"We have lost the trust of the community," Tariq Riebl of the nonprofit International Rescue Committee told NBC News from Goma.</p>
<p class=""><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30063-5/fulltext">A study conducted in September</a>, less than two months into the outbreak, found that 25 percent of people surveyed in the affected areas did not believe Ebola was real, while 36 percent thought it was fabricated to destabilize the region.</p>

<p class="">“It’s all about money, that we’re getting bonuses for cases we find, that prolonging the response helps the business side,” Riebl said, listing some of the lies that have been spreading among local communities.</p>

<p class="">Anifa Vahavi is a demographic researcher working in Butembo, which is one of the worst-affected areas.</p>
<p class="">She has encountered skepticism about Ebola's existence and origins, and questions about why aid workers take extra precautions when treating it compared to malaria or cholera.</p>
<p class="">Ebola treatment centers established by the central government in conjunction with international aid groups have been met with suspicion. Designed to isolate and treat suspected cases of Ebola and staffed by health workers wearing bulky “space suits,” the centers come with an increased presence of police and military forces.</p>

<p class="">Some people in Butembo even believe that "when you go there they inject you with the disease," according to Vahavi, 30, who collects data for a Congolese nonprofit.</p>

<p class="">The Ebola outbreak is also taking place in a part of the country that has suffered regular violence at the hands of armed groups. Health workers have increasingly come under threat, causing further setbacks to the emergency response.</p>
<p class="">On Friday, the World Health Organization said an Ebola doctor was killed in an attack on Butembo University Hospital.</p>
<p class="">Hours later attackers armed with machetes tried to burn down another treatment center, the city's deputy mayor said Saturday.</p>

<p class="">Two centers run by Doctors Without Borders, along with the Ministry of Health, <a href="https://www.msf.org.uk/article/drc-msf-suspends-medical-activities-after-second-ebola-treatment-centre-attack">were attacked three days apart</a> in February, forcing health workers to suspend operations.</p>
<p class="">Speaking after the second attack, Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=564&amp;v=nrnijcaHHw8">described the “great hostility” against the Ebola response</a>, adding “the use of security forces and police only deepens the suspicion of those who believe Ebola is being used as a political tool.”</p>
<p class="">Deeply entrenched opposition to the government in the areas affected by the epidemic means that even the arrival of foreign aid is treated with apprehension.</p>

<p class="">He described the timing and location of the outbreak as an "unfortunate coincidence."</p>
<p class="">Ebola was confirmed by the World Health Organization on Aug. 1, months before the country was set to head to the polls. Former President Joseph Kabila, who intended to step down after two terms in office, announced in December that he would postpone voting in the Ebola-hit communities to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<p class="">That has triggered rumors that the government was behind the outbreak — either infecting opposition communities with the virus or exaggerating its spread — to allow Kabila's choice of a successor to win at the polls, Clark said.</p>

<p class="">He’s more optimistic now that the elections have taken place, saying that a vaccination campaign — which reached more than 100,000 people in the Ebola-effected region — has been effective.</p>
<p class="">"Things are improving,” he added.</p>
<p class="">Aid agencies have also taken unprecedented steps to try to assuage local doubts about the Ebola response, including changing how they conduct burials of the dead.</p>

<p class="">Eva Erlach, who heads the regional community engagement program for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the organization has procured transparent body bags for the first time “to show the family that it is actually their loved one that is being buried and it’s not stones or empty coffins.”</p>

<p class="">The decision was not random, but based on reams of data that IFRC volunteers have collected during home visits with local communities to better understand their concerns. Some 800 volunteers working across eastern Congo have collected over 150,000 comments so far, which are put into a database to share with other organizations on the ground.</p>
<p class="">“Our role is really to make sure that in anything we’re doing, we are in dialogue with the communities and there is an understanding of what our role is and what is being implemented,” Erlach said.</p>
<p class="">Riebl, with the International Rescue Committee, said the situation still couldn't be compared to the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/who-ebola-outbreak-west-africa-over-n496306" target="_blank" class=" vilynx_listened">2014 outbreak in West Africa</a> that killed more than 11,000 people in six countries in the region, with cases also popping up overseas.</p>

<p class="">Over the weeks leading up to the European Parliament elections that started Thursday and continue through Sunday, there has been a great deal of media focus on the rise of the European far-right. However, we should avoid the temptation of overinterpreting the election returns once they come in. Yes, far-right parties will make some gains in some countries, but the results will likely show more continuity in European political trends than deep change.</p>
<p class="">Far-right parties will likely do very well in Hungary, Italy and possibly in France. But there could also be a “Brexit effect” —a realization among voters jolted by the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union that European unity cannot be taken for granted, prompting them to turn out in support of pro-E.U. parties.</p>
<div class="container___1unUn mv8 smallContainer___VvWON mt2-m"><p class="text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond">Yes, far-right parties will make some gains in some countries, but the results will likely show more continuity in European political trends than deep change.</p></div>
<p class="">In reality, these are 28 separate elections held among 350 million eligible citizens across the entire continent. They determine who will represent these countries in the 751-member European Parliament, which regulates much of the E.U.'s economic life, as well as funds European defense, infrastructure projects and development assistance. But they are heavily influenced by domestic politics and issues, charismatic political figures and broader European issues, such as migration, the appropriate amount of E.U. bureaucracy and the pace of European integration.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<div id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"></div>
<p class="">Altogether, the election results will likely be more of the same in European political dynamic. Those dynamics are important; the weakening of the traditional center-left and center-right parties, the rise of Euroskeptic and far-right parties, and the fragmentation of the broader political spectrum erodes the European project, as well as the stability and prosperity it provides the West. But though these elections could negatively shape the E.U.’s future in lasting ways, it will not end the E.U. as we know it.</p>
<p class="">There’s a chance far-right parties will do well enough to band together to challenge the three leading groups in the center (the center-right Christian democrats, center-left social democrats and centrist liberals), and a strong showing by these parties would give an unwelcome boost of confidence to the forces of illiberal democracy and neo-authoritarianism. But fears of their growing power added to the Brexit backlash raise the prospect that pro-E.U. parties can to some degree counterbalance the surging far right.</p>

<p class="">Already defying the dire warnings of some pundits and pollsters who predicted Netherland’s new far-right party, Forum for Democracy, would get the most votes in the parliamentary contest, the center-left Labour Party may have gained the most seats, according to exit polls.</p>
<div class="ad tc tl-m ad-container boxinlineAd dn-print" data-test="ad__container"><div data-enigma="true" data-slot="boxinline" data-sizes="[[[1000,1],[]],[[758,1],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[728,90],[360,360]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[700,50],[5,5],[360,360]]]]" data-render-on-view="true" data-targeting="{}" data-active-tab="true" data-offset-viewport="50"></div></div>
<p class="">In fact, it is likely that these elections will produce a range of outcomes in which every political grouping can claim its side won. So the more immediate and interesting post-election drama — and the potentially more significant implications for Europe and the United States — will occur within a select group of E.U. countries. In these cases, the European Parliament elections serve as "mini-referendums" on the popularity and effectiveness of current governments and their leaders, portending the results of upcoming national elections. Negative tallies can exert domestic political pressures that force some governments to adjust their policies or the composition of ministers.</p>

<p class="">In Italy, Matteo Salvini, deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League (Lega) party, could well be empowered to attempt to take full control of the country. Salvini stands to gain the most from the European Parliament vote. As the putative head of the pan-European far-right and beneficiary of former White House adviser Steve Bannon’s<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/steve-bannon-is-in-france-ahead-of-european-parliament-elections.html"> encouragement</a>, he is trying to unify far-right parties in the European Parliament to challenge the power of the center bloc (though he almost certainly won’t have the numbers to fully usurp them).</p>

<p class="">Should a strong showing this weekend cement Salvini’s current lead in national polls, he might decide it is time to withdraw from the coalition government and trigger new elections to get greater control of the Italian parliament. He has repeatedly stated that he will keep the coalition together, but the election results may prove too tempting. Either way, Salvini will challenge the E.U.'s austerity policies, straining Italian finances and E.U. institutions with global economic ramifications. (Still, the White House would likely welcome Salvini due to his strong anti-immigrant stance and emphasis on the importance of sovereignty.)</p>
<p class="">France might also face a governmental shake-up after this weekend’s vote. Although French President Emmanuel Macron has so far survived his “winter of public discontent” — months of protests and plummeting public support following his imposition of a fuel tax while lowering taxes on the wealthy — the European Parliament elections appear to be a grudge match repeating the French presidential elections in 2017. Macron’s party is running slightly behind his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, in French national polls. Should Le Pen’s party beat Macron’s (Le Pen came in first in the 2014 French European Parliament elections) this weekend, doubts will grow about Macron’s leadership. As in Italy, the White House might not mind having some of the political wind taken out of Macron's sails given that he views himself as a "populist dragon slayer.” But Macron may not be able to improve the French economy as he would like should demonstrations continue and his opinion poll numbers decline, and a weak France doesn’t make for a strong America.</p>
<div class="container___1unUn mv8 smallContainer___VvWON mt2-m"><p class="text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond">The European Parliament elections themselves will likely produce a messy and confused outcome; essentially, more muddle.</p></div>
<p class="">In Germany, meanwhile, political aftershocks may spur Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, to quit the government. The Green Party is poised to become the second-most popular party in Germany once the European Parliament votes are tallied, and the far-right Alternative for Germany party could potentially surpass the SDP as well. Should the SDP leave, Merkel could end up heading a minority government or trying to woo other coalition partners. While President Donald Trump loves to assail German policies, the E.U. cannot progress without clear policy direction from Berlin, and a stalled Europe means significant decisions can't be taken in support of U.S. interests, either.</p>

<p class="">In other words, the European Parliament elections themselves will likely produce a messy and confused outcome; essentially, more muddle. Pro-European forces will outnumber anti- or Euroskeptic voices in parliament, but a rise in the latter will make accomplishing anything more difficult — and it’s not easy now.</p>

<p class="">Prisoners count. But where?</p>

<p class="">Last week, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, signed <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5287-S2.PL.pdf" target="_blank">a bill </a>to make his state the latest to require that prisoners be counted at their pre-incarceration addresses — instead of where they're serving time — to end the practice of what critics call "prison gerrymandering."</p>
<p class="">That's important, advocates say, because the Census Bureau currently counts prisoners as residents of the locations where they're imprisoned, and states use the census data to draw their legislative maps.</p>
<p class="">While a significant number of correctional facilities are located in comparatively rural areas that are largely Republican and predominantly white, prisoners tend to hail from urban, often Democratic communities and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/30/shrinking-gap-between-number-of-blacks-and-whites-in-prison/" target="_blank">are disproportionately minorities</a>, criminal justice experts told NBC News.</p>
<p class="">Advocates of change, including many Democrats, say it's unfair to count prisoners as residents of <a href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/problem/local.html" target="_blank">communities whose demographic makeup and needs</a> differ from the places the inmates call home. They argue that inflating the power of residents in districts with prisons violates the constitutional principle of one person, one vote.</p>
<section class="embedWidget medium___Qn3DV"><div class="usePresentation___EGHVR"><div id="embed-20190515-prisons-gerrymandering-state-law"></div></div></section>
<p class="">But supporters of the status quo, including many Republicans, say prisoners should be counted where they're incarcerated, both because of longstanding tradition and because communities where prisons are located need to receive adequate funding for the services they provide. They characterize efforts to overhaul the counting method as a partisan move that would largely benefit Democrats.</p>

<p class="">The laws that have been enacted in Washington and other states focus solely on adjusting population counts for redistricting and leave funding calculations unchanged.</p>
<p class="">Picture two legislative districts side by side — one with a large prison and one without such a facility. Each sends one state senator to represent its constituents at the statehouse. Districts are required to have roughly equal population sizes, but due to prison gerrymandering, the prisoners are counted as part of the population of the district with the correctional facility. That means the non-incarcerated residents of the district with the prison, even though they are fewer in number than those who live in the neighboring district, enjoy more voting power than residents in the district next door without a prison.</p>

<p class="">African Americans and other minorities have been unjustly undercounted since the census began, Darneille said. "Counting of inmates at the facilities where they are detained is a continuation of this tragic tradition, especially in the era of mass incarceration," she added.</p>
<p class="">Since the first census in 1790, the Census Bureau has counted people based on <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html" target="_blank">the concept of "usual residence," </a>defined as the place where they live and sleep most of the time, which for prisoners means where they're incarcerated.</p>
<p class="">Oliver Hinds, a senior data scientist at the Vera Institute of Justice, said that counting method can distort estimates of legislative district populations. While a significant number of prisons are located in rural areas, he added, "our best estimates" indicate that only 15 percent of the prison population comes from such areas.</p>
<p class="">In setting <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/memo-series/2020-memo-2018_04.html" target="_blank">its rules</a> for the upcoming census, the Census Bureau <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/02/08/2018-02370/final-2020-census-residence-criteria-and-residence-situations#footnote-6-p5526" target="_blank">received </a>almost 78,000 comments on how prisoners are counted, including from former heads of the agency, civil rights groups and <a href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/13senators2016.pdf" target="_blank">elected officials</a> — almost all of whom urged the bureau to tally prisoners at their home addresses.</p>

<p class="">The bureau, however, decided not to change its method of counting prisoners, although states like Washington have passed laws requiring for adjustments to the census population counts during legislative redistricting.</p>

<p class="">Efforts to address the issue at the federal level have gone nowhere. Rep.

<p class="">Absent federal action, New York, Maryland, Delaware and California have passed measures like Washington's, and several other states <a href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/legislation.html#pending" target="_blank">are considering similar legislation</a>.</p>
<p class="">In New Jersey, a bill to end prison gerrymandering passed the Democratic-controlled Senate by a largely party-line vote in February but has not been taken up by the Democrat-led General Assembly.</p>

<p class="">"This bill will ensure the voices in our communities are not diminished because their residents are serving time," Democratic Sen. Nilsa Cruz-Perez, a sponsor of the bill, said. She represents a district that includes Camden.</p>

<p class=""><a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bills/BillView.asp?BillNumber=S758" target="_blank">The only Republican to vote for the measure</a>, state Senate Minority Whip Joseph Pennacchio, said it seemed "unnatural" to count prisoners where they're incarcerated given that they're likely to return to their previous communities upon their release.</p>
<p class="">In vetoing an earlier <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S1000/587_I1.PDF">bill</a> to address the issue, then-Republican Gov. Chris Christie <a href="https://savejersey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/S587AV.pdf" target="_blank">echoed others opposed to changes, saying the measure ran counter</a> to the Census Bureau's longstanding practice, and claiming it made "little sense insofar as prisoners are consuming services and resources at the prison and may have only fleeting, dated, or tenuous ties to their prior residence."</p>
<p class="">In Connecticut, the NAACP <a href="https://www.naacp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NAACP-ComplaintFiled-DLFor062818-release.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> last year to end prison gerrymandering after several <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB0459&amp;which_year=2016" target="_blank">attempts</a> to address the issue <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB05611&amp;which_year=2019" target="_blank">legislatively </a>over the last <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=6606&amp;which_year=2011&amp;SUBMIT1.x=0&amp;SUBMIT1.y=0&amp;SUBMIT1=Normal" target="_blank">decade</a> failed.</p>

<p class="">The president of the NAACP's Connecticut chapter, Scot Esdaile, said he thinks it's unfair that two state senators have the same amount of legislative power despite one representing a district without a prison and another representing a district with a prison in which all the inmates are counted as residents of that district even though all or most never resided there or even voted in the district.</p>
<p class="">"It's a farce, smoke and mirrors," Esdaile said, adding that lawmakers who are blocking change "should be ashamed of themselves of how they’re robbing the people for political gain.”</p>

<p class="">Amanda Eller told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/hawaii-hiker.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> that she was injured when she fell 20 feet off a cliff and later lost her shoes in a flash flood. Ultimately, she said, she was reduced to crawling around the forest.</p>
<p class="">Eller suffered an orthopedic fracture as well as burns on her lower extremities, doctors said Saturday at a news conference.</p>

<p class="">Sarah Haynes told NBC affiliate KHNL her friend's key to survival was "access to water."</p>
<p class="">"She had a waterfall," she said.</p>
<p class="">Dr. Zora Bulatovic of the Maui Memorial Medical Center told reporters Saturday that a patient who had such an experience would normally be dehydrated, but Eller was resourceful.</p>
<p class="">"She was able to manage to stay hydrated with the river water and eating fresh fruit from the trees," she said.</p>

<p class="">Julia Eller said she doesn't think her daughter will return to hiking soon. "We'll have her on a break from hiking for a bit," she said.</p>
<p class="lastMarkupItem">Meanwhile Maui police and fire officials were searching Saturday for another missing hiker, 28-year-old Noah Mina, thought to be in the Iao Valley. He has been missing for five days.</p>

<div data-ad-pos="inread" data-ad-size="1x1" class="ad gpt ad-h-1" id="ad-inread-1x1"></div>
<p>The update came more than a month after Tibbetts was last seen jogging near her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, on July 18, about an hour's drive away from Pella.&nbsp;She was staying at her boyfriend's house at the time to watch his dogs while he was out of town.</p>
<p>The next day, when Tibbetts failed to show up for work, her boyfriend,&nbsp;Dalton Jack, and family became concerned and reported her missing.</p>

<p>Iowa resident&nbsp;Devin Riley&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/iowa-man-person-mollie-tibbetts/story?id=57119283" target="_blank">tells ABC News</a>&nbsp;he may have been the last person to see Tibbetts&nbsp;— as she ran by his home on the evening of July 18.</p>
<p>"I've seen her probably three to four times per week,” he <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/mollie-tibbetts-search-iowa-man-says-maybe-was-last-person-to-see-her.html" target="_blank">explains</a>. “She'd kind of jog down the street and towards the hill. I thought nothing of it until I heard somebody was missing, and it really hit me that I hadn't seen that runner since then."</p>
<p>Riley tells ABC News authorities took about 15 minutes to walk through his home, and they were&nbsp;"really polite."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Crime Stoppers of Central Iowa says the organization has passed on more than 830 tips to authorities investigating the disappearance of Tibbetts.</p>
<h3>Aug. 8</h3>
<p>Blake Jack, the brother of Tibbetts’ boyfriend, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/brother-mollie-tibbetts-boyfriend-says-no-sign-struggle-at-home-would-have-done-something.html" target="_blank">tells Fox News</a> exclusively on Aug. 8 there was no sign of a struggle at the Brooklyn home she was staying in at the time.</p>
<p>“She’s small, but she would have done something,” he adds.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old says both Tibbetts' Fitbit and phone are missing</p>
<h3>Aug. 6</h3>

<p>"It's totally speculation on my part, but I think Mollie is with someone that she knows, that is in over their head," Rob says. "That there was some kind of misunderstanding about the nature of their relationship and at this point they don't know how to get out from under this."</p>

<p>Authorities <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/05/mollie-tibbetts-investigators-following-hundreds-leads-authorities-say.html" target="_blank">say they are</a> following "hundreds" of leads.</p>
<p>Police say the body of a woman in her early-to-mid-20s turned up in Lee County, more than an hour's drive southeast of Brooklyn.</p>
<div class="embed-media twitter"><div class="tweet-embed"></div></div>
<p>However, state police tell Fox News the body was not Tibbetts; investigators plan to release the woman's identity after notifying her family.</p>
<h3>Aug. 4</h3>
<p>Farmer Wayne Cheney speaks to Fox News&nbsp;— one day after the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/04/fbi-speaks-to-pig-farmer-for-second-time-about-missing-mollie-tibbetts.html" target="_blank">FBI went back to his farm</a> to question him in connection with Tibbetts' disappearance.</p>
<p>During the interview, Cheney says he would let the FBI search his entire property; he expressed confidence the bureau wouldn't find anything. So far, the FBI has searched his home and parts of his property, and looked through his cellphone.</p>
<p>He also claims he's never seen Tibbetts before, because he doesn't venture into Brooklyn, where she lives.</p>
<p>As for what the FBI has asked him about, his response was "I don't know."</p>
<p>Cheney says law enforcement asked him to take a polygraph test and he refused. He has not been charged with a crime and says he “has nothing to hide.”</p>
<h3>Aug. 3&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Kevin Winker, director of investigative operations with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, speaks about the case at a news conference.</p>
<p>"Although we appreciated everyone that showed up today to this press conference, our position has not changed on the release of case facts, results and conclusions," <a href="http://abc7news.com/missing-college-student-mollie-tibbetts-a-timeline/3816516/" target="_blank">Winker says</a>. "I understand this is frustrating for many in the public and the media, but feel this is necessary for our investigation."</p>
<p>Winker is also asked about suspects while at the briefing.</p>
<p>"As far as suspects go, we continue to look at all possibilities," he says. "I'm not in a position right now to say, we have suspects, we don't have suspects, persons of interest or anything else."</p>
<p>Later, Winker says authorities are handling the case as "a missing persons investigation."</p>
<p>That same day, the FBI returned to a farm <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/04/fbi-speaks-to-pig-farmer-for-second-time-about-missing-mollie-tibbetts.html" target="_blank">to again question Wayne Cheney in connection with Tibbetts' disappearance</a>.</p>
<p>An FBI agent was seen by Fox News arriving and speaking to Cheney for about five to 10 minutes Friday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Aug. 2</h3>
<p>Search teams scan ditches for traces of Tibbetts near a farm investigators searched a week prior after a possible new clue to her disappearance — a red shirt spotted by a person mowing the lawn — was apparently found.</p>
<h3>Aug. 1</h3>
<p>Tibbetts' father, Rob, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/01/mollie-tibbetts-dad-urges-any-witness-to-come-forward-says-somebody-knows-something.html" target="_blank">urges the public</a> to come forward with any information regarding his missing daughter in an interview with Fox News Channel.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is somebody knows something," Rob says, adding Brooklyn is a small city and “you can’t do anything there without someone seeing it.”</p>
<p>Rob also reveals Tibbetts' phone has not yet been located, and she has not been responsive to messages.</p>
<p>Local farmer Wayne Cheney confirms to Fox News FBI investigators searched his property and home a week prior. Authorities held his cell phone overnight, checking it for any clues or communications regarding Tibbetts.</p>
<p>"I don't know who those two [officials] were but they took me down to the fire station Tuesday and questioned me for two hours,” the farmer told WHO-DT. "I don’t remember what they asked me."</p>
<p>WHO-DT, citing Iowa court documents, reports the farmer previously entered guilty pleas for two instances of stalking – one in Poweshiek County in 2009 and another in Marion County in 2014.</p>
<h3>July 31</h3>
<p>Police in Pella say a man being sought for taking pictures of female joggers on July 27 has turned himself in.</p>
<p>Investigator Kevin Winker says during an afternoon news conference that officials are continuing to follow every tip that comes in about Tibbetts.</p>
<p>Investigators are still unsure about what exactly happened to Tibbetts, Winker says, though they can confirm&nbsp;her disappearing on her own is "not consistent with her past."</p>
<h3>July 28</h3>
<p>Family members tell&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kcci.com/article/new-details-provide-more-insight-the-night-mollie-tibbetts-was-last-seen/22582278" target="_blank">KCCI</a>&nbsp;new evidence reveals Tibbetts’ was doing homework on her computer late into the evening on July 18, suggesting she returned to the home where her&nbsp;boyfriend, his brother and the brother's fiancee live.</p>
<h3>July 27</h3>
<p>Pella Police receive a call about a suspicious man taking photos of female joggers from a parked car.</p>
<p>“As covertly as he possibly could, took photos of them unbeknownst to them, it seemed to be very creepy,”&nbsp;Pella Police Chief Robert Bokinsky tells&nbsp;<a href="https://whotv.com/2018/07/28/pella-police-searching-for-suspicious-man-in-parked-car-seen-taking-pictures-of-young-joggers/" target="_blank">WHOTV</a>.</p>
<div class="embed-media twitter"><div class="tweet-embed"></div></div>
<p>However, authorities didn't say whether there was a link between the suspicious man and Tibbetts’ disappearance.</p>
<p>"[There's] nothing illegal about taking a picture of somebody, if that’s what he did," Pella, Lt. Shane Cox explains to Fox News.</p>
<h3>July 26</h3>
<p>Mitch Mortvedt, a spokesman for the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weareiowa.com/news/local-news/hog-farm-searched-nothing-found-from-mollie-tibbetts/1326251977" target="_blank">tells Local 5</a>&nbsp;more than a dozen agents from his group and the FBI have been conducting searches of several properties in Iowa, including a hog farm, but nothing has been found. He added the searches have not expanded outside the state and there are currently no suspects in the case.</p>

<p>There are new signs that the<span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-will-fly-again-but-no-one-knows-when/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> Boeing 737 Max </a></span>won't be flying passengers for a while after the Federal Aviation Administration met with foreign regulators in Fort Worth Thursday to discuss the jet's future. Features on the plane <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-audio-reveals-pilots-confronting-official-about-features-suspected-in-deadly-crashes-2019-05-14/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">may have been a factor</a></span> in two <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-737-max-boeing-didnt-tell-airlines-that-safety-alert-wasnt-working-until-after-crash/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">deadly crashes </a></span>in the past year. </p>
<p>Acting FAA administrator Daniel Elwell told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave the agency does not have a timeline for when they expect to get the 737 Max flying passengers again. </p>
<p>"We have to finish our system safety analysis, there will be some test flights that have to be done," Elwell said. "And when we're convinced that the 737 Max is safe to fly again, we will lift the prohibition order."</p>
<p>Aviation regulators from 33 countries where the Boeing 737 Max flies came to a FAA facility in Fort Worth Thursday. At a closed-door meeting Elwell laid out the agency's plan for certifying the Max as safe. Some countries did not attend – a sign the Max may start flying first in the U.S. while the world watches.</p>
<p> "None of us are going to lift the prohibition on the 737 Max until its safe to do so," Elwell said.</p>
<p>As Elwell makes his case for the rest of the aviation world to trust the FAA when the agency is ready to deem the 737 Max ready to fly again, new research shows Americans are leery about setting foot on the Max – even when it's cleared to fly.</p>
<p>A new study by Atmosphere Research Group found only about 1 in 5 people surveyed would definitely fly on a Max in the first six months of its return to service. Roughly half said they'd be unlikely to get on board.</p>
<p> "So it's important that the FAA doesn't regulate by survey, right? We regulate … where in the last 10 years in the United States, 90 million flights, 7 billion passengers carried with one fatality," Elwell said. </p>
<p>Pressed on the how they'll handle public opinion that the plane isn't safe, Elwell said, "Yes we need to be concerned if the public is concerned about flight, yes is that bothersome? It's bothersome. But we can't respond specifically to that concern when it comes to setting safety standards."</p>
<p>It could be the fall before the plane has passengers on it. Boeing said it's still answering information requests from the FAA about the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boeing has hired a PR firm to help restore trust in the Max and plans to rely heavily on pilots as a show of confidence in the plane but some pilots are saying they're not interested in being arm candy.</p>

<p>As a Chicago police officer, Shannon Spalding worked undercover in some of the toughest parts of the city -- only to discover some of the most dangerous criminals were fellow police officers.&nbsp; She risked her life to stop them.</p>
<p>Soon after joining the Chicago Police Department in 1996, Spalding drew an assignment in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city.&nbsp; "It was a full-blown war every single day," she said.</p>
<p>"It was like a movie set.&nbsp; I was shocked.&nbsp; It was shock and awe for me.&nbsp; It was just a completely different world," she explained to <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/whistleblower/" rel="noopener">"Whistleblower"</a> host Alex Ferrer in the series' second season premiere airing Friday, May 24 at 8/7c on CBS.</p>
<p>To survive, Spalding leaned on veteran cops like <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-police-officer-accused-of-extortion-planting-evidence-who-would-believe-us-over-him/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Ronald Watts</a>.</p>
<p>"I thought he was battling crime and he was doing it with finesse and grace," she said.</p>
<p>In 2006, a decade after Spalding was trained by Watts, she had a new assignment in the narcotics division.</p>
<p>"I was the undercover.&nbsp; I would go out, I would make the controlled narcotics purchases," Spalding explained.</p>
<p>Her partner, Danny Echeverria, would swoop in and make arrests. &nbsp; But during police interviews, something strange started happening. </p>
<p>"People would say … 'I can't believe you're going to arrest me when one of your own is actually running the narcotics trade,'" said Spalding.</p>
<p>Spalding learned Watts and his crew would plant drugs on residents of the Ida B. Wells projects and extort cash.</p>
<p>"Even the good citizens that live there, that are law-abiding citizens, they're subjected to this," she said. "We heard … he would put anything from a couple bags to enough to put you away for 10, 15, 20 years."</p>
<p>In 2006, Ida B. Wells resident Delores Allen witnessed this practice firsthand when her son Zarice was pushed up against Watts' police car.</p>
<p>"He goes in his pocket, brings out the drugs.&nbsp; 'If you guys -- I catch y'all again, I'm going to put these drugs on your ass.' That's his exact words," said Delores Allen.</p>
<p>Allen says Watts kept his word.</p>
<p>Later that year, Zarice was arrested and charged with felony possession of heroin and crack cocaine; he was 17 years old. Allen says the drugs were planted by Watts.</p>
<p>"I just seen all his hopes and dreams and stuff just go," an emotional Allen said. "It just went down the drain from there."</p>
<p>Spalding and her partner would eventually learn <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecutors-investigating-if-corrupt-chicago-cop-tainted-other-convictions/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Watts' bad deeds</a></span> had been going on for years.</p>
<p>"If we don't report this criminal conduct we're absolutely no better than Watts or any of these other corrupt officers.&nbsp; And if we do we may just be ending our careers and putting our self in real danger," said Spalding.</p>

<p>Soon after 10-year-old Darlyn Valle crossed the southern border into the U.S. last year, personnel with the Border Patrol determined <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-death-a-10-year-old-migrant-girl-died-last-year-in-government-care-officials-acknowledge-exclusive/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">she had a debilitating heart condition</a></span>.</p>
<p>Valle had somehow made the 1,400 mile journey from her native El Salvador to Texas, according to Carlos Martinez, president of Asociacion Cívica Salvadoreña de Nebraska, an Omaha nonprofit group that helped arrange legal and postmortem assistance for the girl's family. Valle's name was confirmed to CBS News by the girl's mother.</p>
<p>Valle was just over halfway through the trek from El Salvador to Omaha, where her mother lives, when Border Patrol apprehended her in March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But she didn't make it to Omaha until September 26. Officials brought her there so she could spend her final three days near her mom.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately right now, the facilities that we have, the resources we've been afforded, and the legal framework that we operate under is not sufficient, is absolutely overwhelmed and it's insufficient. And that continues to be an ongoing challenge," said Robert Perez of Customs and Border Patrol.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark Weber, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday that the agency oversaw the medical care for a dying 10-year-old girl last year. He said the girl had a history of congenital heart defects. Her death was previously undisclosed to the public.</p>

<p>Martinez's group was founded in 2012, and helps families send bodies of deceased loved ones to El Salvador. Martinez said the government of El Salvador helped pay for the return of Valle's body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valle's death was the first of a migrant child in federal care since 2010, according to federal officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the eight months since Valle' death, five children from Guatemala have died either in U.S. custody or soon after being released from custody to a hospital. They ranged in age from 2 1/2 to 16.</p>
<p>The wave of deaths has led lawmakers to call for an investigation into the medical practices of Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>
<p>Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, blamed the White House for the rash of deaths. "As Trump plays politics with asylum-seeking children and their parents, the results are increasingly deadly — with six children dying in U.S. custody since September 2018," Grijalva said in a press release Thursday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with CBS News Wednesday night, Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Joaquin Castro <span class="link"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joaquin-castro-says-trump-administration-covered-up-death-of-migrant-girl/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">accused the administration of concealing the girl's death</a></span>, and said he wanted the government to turn over more information. "We're going to make immediate inquires to HHS to find out what happen to this young girl," Castro said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, chair of the subcommittee that funds the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said in a statement that she would "ensure accountability and transparency."</p>
<p>"It is outrageous that Trump administration officials waited nearly eight months before releasing any information," the statement read. "What would drive these officials to cover up such a serious matter?"</p>
<p>Officials are required to notify local child welfare authorities and report such deaths internally, but are not required to announce them to the public.</p>

Main Content node:

<p>Yoga instructors are accusing America's largest chain of yoga studios of underpaying its teachers. More than 1,500 yoga instructors have joined a class action lawsuit against CorePower Yoga, claiming CorePower teachers "are overstretched and not being paid the minimum wages they are entitled."</p>
<p>"CorePower probably started out with a mission and a goal that they wanted to bring yoga to everybody, but then it turned into a way to monetize," instructor Effie Morgenstern told "CBS This Morning: Saturday" co-host Dana Jacobson.  </p>
<p>"It's a business that is hiding behind the guise of yoga," another yoga instructor Melissa Brennan said.</p>

<p>Brennan and Morgenstern said during their years teaching at CorePower Yoga, the company didn't pay them what they were legally entitled to. <br><strong><br></strong>"Once you get the job, you're expected to be compensated for the work you do off the clock," Morgenstern said. "Frankly $15 an hour does not compensate you for that work you do off the clock."</p>
<p> "What is that work... and how much time are we talking about?" Jacobson asked.</p>
<p> "We're constantly having to change our playlist, constantly having to sequence, testing it out," Brennan said. "The expectation is go off... do all of this work and then come back and bring it back to the studio." </p>
<p> They said for every one-hour class that they taught, they had to put in up to an additional six hours – unpaid. <br><strong><br></strong>They claim the company is in violation of the fair labor standards act by failing "to pay its instructors for certain hours worked, causing their average weekly compensation to drop below the minimum wages they are entitled."<br><strong><br></strong>"They hide behind the fact that you have all this gratitude and love and appreciation for yoga and your peers, and we met this way," Morgenstern said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"In a lot of ways they weaponize relationships," Brennan said. "I know there is a part of me that feels really foolish for really buying into that and thinking that these people did care about me."</p>
<p> The suit, the fourth class action with similar complaints against CorePower, also addresses how the company pressures instructors to recruit students to sign up for a $3,000 teacher training.<strong> </strong></p>
<p> "Part of your performance is based on how many people you recruit into the teacher training programs," Brennan said.</p>
<p>"Because they make a lot of money off of those teacher training programs," Jacobson added. </p>
<p> "They do," Brennan said, adding, "They… intentionally keep your wages low unless you do things like sell their teacher trainings, unless you recruit more people into the fold, until you grow that community." </p>
<p> "Somebody would say that's an incentive based. So you have pay but that's your incentive. Why isn't it that?" Jacobson asked.</p>
<p>"When you have a place... that is just charging the maximum, profiting off of their students, dragging people into teacher trainings, and then pouring out teachers... it just dilutes the whole spirit of yoga," Brennan said.</p>
<p> Sheetal Shah agrees.<br><strong><br></strong>"It's absolutely anti-yoga," Shah said. </p>
<p> She launched the "Take Back Yoga" campaign to highlight the Indian roots of the ancient philosophy.<br><strong><br></strong>"It just goes against the very basic tenets of yoga, satya, truthfulness," Shah said. "And you're violating that by telling teachers to prey upon students who may or may not be good as teachers and bring them in for the sole purpose of making money."</p>
<p> Brennan now works out of independent yoga studios, and Morgenstern said she still works at CorePower because some money is better than none.<br></p>
<p>"I don't really have a need to leave aside from the underpayment," Morgenstern said.</p>
<p>"You'd rather make it right?" Jacobson asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'd rather right and I'd rather make it known that we are underpaid," she responded.</p>
<p>In a statement to CBS News, CorePower Yoga said this lawsuit is without merit and maintains there was no wrongdoing. The company adds, "CorePower is proud of its practices, believes they are fair and will continue to stand by and defend them." The case is expected to be settled out of court, and those three other lawsuits we mentioned were also settled.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Making matters worse, the DRC's quarter-century-old civil war is disrupting efforts to treat and contain Ebola. Violence and mistrust hamper efforts, as treatment centers are often attacked by militia groups, and people are either too scared or too suspicious to seek medical assistance here.</p>

<p>CBS News' Debora Patta reports that the city of Beni has been in constant misery after 25 years of civil war. </p>
<p>Nine people were killed in one village by an armed militia group in the past week; then, soldiers took the victims to be tested for disease. It's standard practice – Ebola is at its most contagious immediately after death.</p>
<p>But it doesn't help win over an already suspicious community. "We don't understand what this Ebola is; we can bury the bodies of our people ourselves," said one villager.</p>
<p>A 3,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force is deployed in this area to protect villagers from the more than 30 armed militia groups that terrorize the community.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Outreach programs have been launched to educate people about Ebola, but mistrust runs deep, and many don't believe Ebola is as big a problem as security.</p>
<p>USAID's Dr. Bill Clemmer has worked in the DRC for more than two decades and helped with previous Ebola outbreaks.</p>
<p>"I have never been in a context where people throw rocks at our vaccination team, where they block roads, where they loot and pillage our health care facilities," he said. </p>
<p>Beni has all the tools to fight the disease at its disposal, but they are useless if the sick and the dying hide in their homes refusing medical treatment.</p>

<p>Deep inside Vatican City lies a bunker holding a remarkable historical record – a catalog of every word written by every pope over more than 1,000 years. The secret archive holds millions of church documents including decrees and correspondence from every pope dating back more than a millennia.</p>
<p> Lined up, it would stretch more than 50 miles – about the length of the Panama Canal. Today, only academics with special permission can access it; otherwise it's locked away.</p>
<p> Marco Maiorino, a paleographer who studies ancient texts, showed CBS News' Seth Doane the frescoed room where the archives started. Valuable records – including a papal correspondence from the 13th century – have not been digitized and remain inaccessible for most. The document includes obscure abbreviations and are handwritten in Medieval Latin. </p>
<p>Transcribing them is difficult for a human expert, Maiorino said. It's even more difficult for a computer, which needs to identify letters to transcribe and make text searchable. Enter an unlikely group of helpers: hundreds of high schoolers in Rome who are teaching the computers how to read the handwritten Latin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The program doesn't know which of these letters are an 'e' or a 'b' so by highlighting them we can teach the program," explained one of the students taking part in the effort. <br></p>
<p>The idea to include the high schoolers was Paolo Merialdo's, a professor at Roma Tre University in Rome. Merialdo enlisted 600 Italian high school students to help the computers develop a linguistic artificial intelligence. </p>
<p> "We are providing a sort of 'Google Translate' for paleographers," Merialdo said. </p>
<p> Artificial intelligence can "democratize" these documents by allowing them to be digitized and made accessible beyond the Vatican walls. The technology could also one day be used to decipher ancient manuscripts anywhere. If successful, so many more people will be able to explore the ancient writings that surround them.</p>

<p>Bryan Cranston is a Tony Award nominee for his performance in the Broadway version of the 1976 satire "Network," in which news anchor Howard Beale has an on-air breakdown, becoming a "mad prophet of the airwaves." Cranston exhorts his viewers to get "mad as hell" about the state of the world.</p>
<p>His rants create a sensation, and his bosses exploit Beale to get better TV ratings for the news.</p>

<p>On "CBS This Morning" Friday, Cranston was asked how he is able to bring forth such anger to his role night after night. "You know, it's part of the actor's toolkit to be able to go inward, to your own personal experiences, and pull out whatever you need at any given time – rage, jealously, love, joy," he said. </p>
<p>"Anger is an emotion that makes people very uncomfortable, but it is also so necessary," said co-host Gayle King. </p>
<p>"Anger, especially now, is usually shunned in our society," Cranston said. "When we see someone who is angry, we don't want to be anywhere around them. But there's a lot of anxiety in our social circles now, in our country, a lot of bitterness and divisiveness. And perhaps anger is a way to drive and release that pressure." </p>
<p>While performing Beale's televised rants, Cranston will go off-stage and interact with audience members, even sitting in the orchestra and sneaking food out of someone's takeout bag. "I have free reign to do whatever Howard Beale wants to do at that moment," he said, "because it's important for that moment, for that audience to see that he is promulgating the idea of letting go. He has gone over to the other side. He says, 'Don't struggle anymore, don't fight against the machine. Let go.'" </p>

<p>Cranston was asked how he approached a character made famous in the film by Peter Finch, who won an Oscar for his performance. "Well, every time you take on a character, for an actor it's outside of you, and the more I work, the more I do research, the more I get into the head of this man, the more he's invited in. And at some point you just trust that the character – for lack of a better term, osmosis – just sinks in to you, and then you operate from that point of view." </p>
<p>Co-host Tony Dokoupil asked what the relevance of the story was today, compared to when Paddy Chayefsky wrote the original film's screenplay in the 1970s. </p>
<p>"When I was a kid growing up watching Walter Cronkite, I always believed what I was listening to was just pure news," Cranston said, "and I believe it still was, but there were decisions being made by producers back then, as there are now. You have 25 stories; we can only get to 12. Who makes that decision of what you're <em>not</em> going to say? Who decides what's news, and what's the more important news? And you hope that it's altruistic in that decision-making. But sometimes an ideology does [influence], 'Well, I believe this is true, so this is what we're going to say.'"</p>
<p>"What's the problem with media today?" Dokoupil asked. "Is it television, as 'Network' has it, or is it now social media?"</p>
<p>"I don't think that today's television media can be absolved of the responsibility of being able to put forward honest good journalism," Cranston said. "Everyone is under pressure of ratings. Ratings and making money. And sometimes you'll see programs that [are] all about promoting that night's shows and things. You're like, 'Is this news, or are we just a promotional vehicle for something else?'" </p>
<p>King asked, "Do you look at [news] differently after playing the role?" </p>
<p>"I think you look at it with a little bit of skepticism, and I think that's prudent," he said. "I think the point of 'Network' is not to put yourself in any kind of tribalistic, ideological camp, to allow yourself to open up, to receive different ideas from all different sources and make up your own mind." </p>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad Paragraph__isDropCap">Australia has issued a new 50 cent coin celebrating some of the country's indigenous languages, many of which are at risk of extinction. </div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">The new design incorporates 14 translations of the word "coin" from languages native to the Australian continent, developed in collaboration by the Royal Australian Mint and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS).</div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"These coins are a celebration of Australia's unique and diverse indigenous languages, we hope the coins will serve as a tangible reminder of the important efforts being undertaken to preserve, protect and revitalize indigenous languages in Australia" Mint CEO Ross MacDiarmid <a href="https://www.ramint.gov.au/publications/international-year-indigenous-languages-commemorated-new-coins-launched-royal" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. </div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">The coin was launched in Adelaide, South Australia, on April 8, and features the indigenous language of the traditional people of the area, the Kaurna. It was launched as part of countrywide efforts to mark the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages.</div>

<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">More than 1,000 languages around the world are listed as either severely or critically endangered by UNESCO, and hundreds of indigenous tongues <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/endangered-languages-welsh-hawaiian-cantonese-intl/index.html" target="_blank">have gone extinct since records began in 1950</a>.  </div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">Languages connect people to their historical culture and community, and groups that retain their indigenous languages have been <a href="https://www.arts.gov.au/what-we-do/indigenous-arts-and-languages/2019-international-year-indigenous-languages/australian-government-action-plan-2019-international-year-indigenous-languages" target="_blank">shown to have improved</a> social and emotional well-being, compared to groups which have lost their traditional tongues. </div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">"Indigenous languages carry more meaning than the words themselves, so too does currency carry meaning beyond its monetary value. The release of these coins is another milestone in recognizing the diverse cultures that shape our national story of over 60,000 years," Craig Ritchie, CEO of AIATSIS, said in a statement.</div>
<div class="Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad">In Australia, around 130 indigenous languages have <a href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/indigenous-australian-languages" target="_blank">died out </a>since Europeans invaded the continent in 1788. A blank spot on the new coin is designed to represent those languages that have been lost. </div>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RMsAvK">Leasha Ali had been drunk for the last two days, but she didn’t want to be anymore. The 39-year-old math teacher and mother of two was in a spiral familiar to anyone who’s struggled with addiction. A difficult event — a hospitalization, thanks to lingering symptoms from a birth defect — had stressed her to the breaking point, and then she’d gotten home and found herself alone in her house, depressed and unable to sleep. After a few days without drinking, she gave in, and spent the next 48 hours on a bender.</p>


<p id="k7Rlar">On the second night, January 8th of this year, she got an email from the hospital. Her liver enzymes had been dangerously high — even before the days of abuse. The birth defect that put her in the hospital had already left her with several damaged organs. Afraid of hurting another, she searched the test results in Google. Right there at the top was an ad for rehab. </p>


<p id="wIwAuK">“I thought to myself, ‘Oh my God, even Google knows I need rehab,’” Ali told me.</p>


<p id="mdqShn">It’s hard to say exactly who was on the other end, when, just before 11PM, Ali called the number in the ad. The 800 number was ephemeral. It’s missing from Yellow Pages listings, social media, and even sites for complaints about telemarketers and spam, and it was disconnected by the time I called it. The untraceability is frustrating, but not surprising. Google offers advertisers unique “tracking” phone numbers that forward to a company’s phones, so they can understand which ads are bringing in the most clients. The phone numbers only stay up as long as the ad does. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="BIdj5W"><q>“Oh my God, even Google knows I need rehab.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="bb3cQu">Ali’s call to the hotline lasted almost an hour. The woman asked for Ali’s insurance details and other personal information, which Ali gave her, but mostly, they talked. Ali told the woman what was going on with her, why she wanted treatment, and what kind of rehab she hoped to end up at. “Somewhere with palm trees,” she remembers requesting.</p>


<p id="6dBMvz">The woman told Ali she’d call back with a referral. Ali fell asleep while waiting.</p>


<div class="c-float-right"><div id="nFfPsx">
<div class="c-entry-sidebar">
  <h3 id="ILqH3K">Key points</h3>
<ul>
<li id="BXcSqL">Google results for phrases like “rehabs near me,” along with the resulting ads, are often peppered with 800 numbers for lead generators, third-party call centers selling potential clients to rehabs</li>
<li id="cy6A1x">Some rehabs run hotlines that <em>seem </em>like unbiased referral services, but refer most patients to treatment centers they own</li>
<li id="LyvLex">The worst operations overbill insurance for tens of thousands of dollars, pay referrers a portion of the bill, and in extreme cases, can look a lot like human trafficking</li>
<li id="F2QYkK">Deceptive practices are common in online rehab marketing, including Google and SEO scams that redirect callers away from legitimate treatment centers</li>
<li id="womMb2">At some call centers, reps are paid bonuses for “performance” (i.e., how many admissions they sign up), and many use high-pressure sales tactics on desperate callers</li>
<li id="tKOaUE">A new law in Florida, where many of the call centers are based, bans deceptive sales tactics for rehabs</li>
<li id="w33P15">It remains unclear how much legislation and other pressures will affect these marketing practices</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div></div>


<p id="NzAL6H">At 8:30AM the next day, her phone rang. It was a placement service called Aid in Recovery, and it’d found a good place for her, a Florida outfit called Wellness Counseling and Residential Detox.</p>


<p id="VLSA3J">“Our mission is to make sure you have the best possible chance to break free from alcohol and drug addiction. We do this by matching your specific needs with the best rehabs across the nation,” Aid in Recovery’s website promised when Ali looked it up. Spending January in Florida was an easy sell. At 12:30PM, Aid in Recovery sent Ali flight information. Four hours later, she was on a plane. </p>


<p id="UlG7K3">“I had a lot of guilt and shame about my drinking, and so I really wanted to stop. I’d been trying to cut back, and I realized I wasn’t going to stop on my own,” Ali told me over the phone a few months after she got out of Wellness. Had she been clearheaded, she thinks she might have noticed the warning signs, like the salespeople telling her that treatment wouldn’t cost her anything.</p>


<p id="rFk9BO">What Ali found in Florida was a far cry from the tailored retreat she was expecting. The facility was in a recently converted ex-motel; she told me her room was crammed with three twin beds and a small chair. Most of her treatment at the understaffed facility consisted of large therapy groups, and personnel were unprepared to deal with her serious medical issues. Having started out looking for help with her alcoholism, she ended up getting a lesson on the complex, opaque web of treatment centers and marketing operations that use the internet and high-pressure telemarketing techniques to profit off a booming market: addicts in America.</p>


<p id="GaAeE9">In the shadow of America’s opioid crisis, an array of business models have sprung up to generate “leads,” marketer-speak for addicts with money — or good insurance. Some are third-party marketers operating referral hotlines, while others are entities owned by and referring to a single rehab company. Some serve both purposes, referring to their own treatment centers and selling the callers they can’t use. While quite a few treatment centers and marketers are honest and upfront, many others use deception and call-center scam tactics to get clients.</p>


<div><aside id="yc2lxh"><q>Some spend huge sums to show up in the searches of desperate people with the right insurance</q></aside></div>


<p id="iwZ8rW">The companies are united by their dependence on Google, some of them spending huge sums on ads to show up in the searches of desperate people with the right insurance. Aid in Recovery, the company that sent Ali to Florida, spends over a million dollars a month on Google search ads for websites they own, according to an estimate by web ad analytics company SpyFu.</p>


<p id="CNaTIG">Florida has taken notice of the industry’s marketing tactics. On June 26th, Governor Rick Scott <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/florida-politics-blog/fl-reg-sober-homes-scott-bill-20170627-story.html">signed a long-awaited ban</a> on deceptive treatment center advertising that outlines specific disclosure requirements and cracks down on other questionable practices that have become common in the rehab industry. The bill, which explicitly covers misleading statements online, passed unanimously in both the Florida House and Senate. </p>


<p id="sWRav8">As of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170624065416/https://aidinrecovery.com/">June 24th</a>, Aid in Recovery’s website continued to imply it was an independent company, as it had when Ali went to Florida: “We have the most accurate and latest information on treatment programs available,” Aid in Recovery said on the front page. “We do not promote any particular approach to addiction treatment, just high success rates.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="IvtiDC"><q>Had she been clearheaded, she thinks she might have noticed the warning signs</q></aside></div>


<p id="ITODCL">By July 9th, Aid in Recovery had changed its web copy, deleting all of the language suggesting they were independent, and adding a disclaimer that the company “is associated with affiliated treatment centers located in AZ, CA, and FL and Aid in Recovery may refer a person to one of these entities if the person’s treatment needs and payment abilities match the treatment offerings at these facilities.” (Aid in Recovery also removed some aggressive and misleading statements about going to rehab far from home, including that “it has been proven that the success rate is higher” when addicts go out of state for treatment.)</p>


<p id="4i15IJ">Some of their affiliates are now named on the website, including Wellness, where Ali went. But those aren’t the only businesses in Aid in Recovery’s network. Company filings and court records reveal a tangled web of holding companies within blandly named holding companies, adding up to a multimillion-dollar rehab business, all tied together by an LLC called <a href="https://treatmentllc.com/">Treatment Management Company</a>. It spans four states, and includes phone rooms, urinalysis labs, detoxes, and rehabs. All of them are connected to one man, Bryan Deering, a millionaire who made his money in concrete.</p>


<p id="RjBvV9">Many are concerned about the way profits in the industry have been prioritized over patient outcomes. In 2015, Michael Lukens, a former business partner of Deering’s, made a YouTube video denouncing unethical behavior in the rehab industry.</p>


<p id="3TUTvF">“I actually have perspective from behind the scenes,” Lukens says on the video. “By and large, the mentality of the owner-operator is continuously putting profits ahead of people.”</p>


<p id="rQ2HyY">“We completely reject any suggestion that we have been deceptive in our operations or in dealing with clients or prospective patients,” Treatment Management Company said in an emailed statement. “Our marketing efforts are in line with other health care companies in the United States.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="XmBRPe">Open another tab, and Google “alcohol rehab near me.” Take a look at the ads up top. (If you have an ad blocker, you’ll have to turn it off.)</p>


<p id="Nh9brP">If you’re in Arizona, and you click on the top ad, you’ll cost that advertiser around $221. If you’re in Colorado, that click costs the site $230. Sorry, New Yorkers, your click is only worth $43 — but if you searched “drug treatment centers,” you’d go for around $121. (These are estimated averages from April this year, provided to <em>The Verge</em> by advertising analytics company SEMrush.)</p>


<p id="VcdZt2">That’s assuming you don’t live in a city with a high percentage of Medicaid recipients. In New Jersey, the statewide cost for ads on “best alcohol rehab centers” searches is $190 per click, but that’s an average. Smart marketers tell Google they don’t want their ads showing up in any searches from Trenton, Camden, or other low-income cities. It’s also good practice, if you’re hoping to attract well-heeled (or at least well-insured) clients, to keep your ads away from searches with words like “free” and “Medicaid.”</p>


<p id="Nw2B06">Of course, there are other ways to prevent poor people from calling your hotline. One of Aid in Recovery’s AdWords listings, which I saw on Google in the middle of August when searching for “treatment center South Florida,” is titled “Addiction Treatment Center - No Medicaid. No Medicare.” When I repeated the search, their listing was titled “Addiction Treatment Center - (Private Insurance Only).” A few days later, I tried “texas rehab” and got an Aid in Recovery listing titled “Luxury Drug/Alc Rehab Centers. - (Private Insurance Only)‎.” All three list different 800 numbers. </p>


<p id="XfDJfu">Some methods of targeting patients are more deceptive. My editor in New York City Googled “rehab” in February; one of the top AdWords results was for The Watershed. “Rehab in NY - Choose The Watershed Rehab,” it read, listing an address in Brooklyn. “No Medicaid/Medicare.” Searching the Brooklyn address brings up their “<a href="https://www.thewatershed.com/locations/">locations</a>” page, which clarifies the rehab “provides treatment services only in our Florida and Texas facility locations,” before listing addresses in 32 other states, including nine in New York and eight in New Jersey. (The other three ads in my editor’s results were for rehabs in Florida.)</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="OecBOV"><q>That click costs the site $230</q></aside></div>


<p id="1ZpCbs">A friend Googling “rehab near me” in the Bay Area in August got ads for a third-party lead generator; a local rehab with a hotline that rang to the parent company’s New Jersey call center; and a site operated by Aid in Recovery (its closest facility is 400 miles away). </p>


<p id="h8R3bA">Once a potential client is on the phone, it’s up to the phone room salesperson to convince them that they should travel to the treatment center the call center is repping, whether or not going away from home was the person’s intention. </p>


<p id="P6pKDW">“Google ‘drug treatment Dayton Ohio,’” Alan Johnson, chief assistant state attorney of Florida, suggested to me. “Call a couple of those numbers that pop up, right up front, and see what you get.” He laughed a little. “See if you actually get somebody in Dayton.” </p>


<p id="KPiHhv">Johnson is head of the Palm Beach County Sober Homes Task Force, which has been helping draft legislation about fraud and other illegal activity in the treatment industry since July 2016.</p>


<p id="U1dtpA">Google declined to comment on the record when I asked them about issues around geographic targeting of ads. </p>

<p id="StvpWD">The search giant actively courts treatment centers, both online and off. In May, a Google “digital ambassador” was a featured speaker at the <a href="https://vendome.swoogo.com/Executive-Marketing-Retreat">Treatment Center Executive &amp; Marketing Retreat</a>, a networking getaway for C-suiters and financiers of addiction treatment businesses. In July, two Google executives talked about AdWords at a <a href="http://www.mhmarketing.org/conference-1/">marketing conference for mental health professionals</a>. And in February, <em>Addiction Professional</em>, the rehab industry’s main trade rag, ran a webinar called “Attracting Patients Online in Their Time of Need.” One of the speakers was Danielle Bulger, a senior account executive with Google’s health care division and a featured speaker at the aforementioned retreat.</p>


<p id="6xBniN">In a study using what Bulger called their “humongous dataset,” Google found 61 percent of people who went to rehab used the internet to find treatment — a bigger number by far than those who relied on their family, friends, or doctors. </p>


<p id="yLSdI4">“While the gravity of the situation is not lost on us here at [Google], we do know that if we do our jobs well as marketers, as digital evangelists, as content producers that answer these very important questions, we can help lives,” Bulger told her listeners.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="7pFVVz"><q>“See if you actually get somebody in Dayton.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="d5tZp6">But the search engine’s ubiquity gives scammers easy access to the same customers, and their business-friendly tools work equally well for black- and white-hat marketing. </p>


<p id="W7bVOO">One of the most common scams is so easy you could try it yourself (but please don’t). Google’s business listings — the snippets that pop up in Google searches or on Maps — all have a little link in them: “<em>Suggest an edit.</em>” If a business hasn’t claimed its listing, it’s easy to change the phone number to anything you want. Scam marketers do it constantly, rerouting a treatment center’s calls to their own hotline, trusting their sales reps to convince the caller they’ve come to the right place, as Alfred Lubrano of the <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/health/addiction/desperate-for-help-heroin-addicts-get-hijacked-to-florida-20170623.html?photo_4"><em>Philadelphia Enquirer</em></a> reported in June. </p>


<p id="7k0aqH">Even if a company <em>has </em>claimed the listing for their center, which usually involves Google mailing a postcard with a security code to the business address, sometimes Google’s algorithm lets spammers’ suggested edits through anyway. Business owners aren’t notified of such changes by email, instead seeing them only if they log into their “Google My Business” account page, according to Tom Waddington, a Google Top Contributor, which means he volunteers to answer user questions in the Google help forums. (In exchange, Google gives him easy ways to escalate reports about scams and other complaints to Google employees, and flies him to Mountain View every year for a special conference.)   </p>


<p id="rBzPrt">“Overall, allowing users to suggest and moderate edits provides comprehensive and up-to-date info, but we recognize there may be occasional inaccuracies or bad edits suggested by users,” a Google spokesperson told me via email. “When this happens, we do our best to address the issue as quickly as possible."</p>


<p id="FTnMei">But experts told me it’s a lot more common than Google suggests.</p>


<p id="Y1AtwI">“If you’re a facility and you don’t check your map on a regular basis, you will be hijacked,” cautioned Johnson. And patients need to be careful, too. Once the rep has you on the line, he says, they’ll tell you whatever they need to to reel you in. If a patient is looking for a specific rehab, Johnson told me the reps might respond, “‘Well they’re full, but we have the same program in Delray Beach.’ Like as not, they hook somebody in, thinking they’re getting something that they’re not getting.”</p>


<div><aside id="roqxEG"><q>“If you’re a facility and you don’t check your map on a regular basis, you will be hijacked.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="lDXnQ3">Sam Bierman, executive director of Maryland Addiction Recovery Center, a strong <a href="http://www.marylandaddictionrecovery.com/addiction-treatment-marketers-stop-social-media-prey-families-parents-crisis">critic</a> of <a href="http://www.marylandaddictionrecovery.com/underbelly-addiction-treatment-unethical-illegal-practices-saving-lives">shady marketing tactics</a>, has a couple of quick and dirty rules for families and doctors on the hunt for a rehab. One is to pay attention to the website’s staff page. If they don’t list their top brass, at the very least, then you have no idea who you’re talking to, and should consider looking elsewhere. He also suggests asking the person who answers the phone if they’re actually at the treatment center. If they tell you they’re based somewhere else, tread carefully. </p>


<p id="eB7ILx">A few weeks before we talked, a fake number showed up on the Google listing for a treatment center owned by a friend of his. Bierman gave it a call. “I said, ‘Are you guys a treatment center?’ ‘No, we’re a national hotline.’ I said, ‘Okay, well are you guys for-profit or not-for-profit?’ And she said, ‘No, we’re a national hotline.’” Then the woman hung up on him. </p>


<p id="xT9IcM">“A lot of it is just taking advantage of consumers who may not know any better,” Bierman told me with anger in his voice.</p>


<p id="uJOqwK">Google has made <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/inside-google-s-secret-war-ad-fraud/298652/">efforts to block such hijacking</a>, but it’s a game of cat and mouse. When lead generators aren’t hijacking real rehab listings, they’re submitting dozens or hundreds of fake ones, spamming Google Maps in an effort to get their 800 number in searches for, say, “rehab Los Angeles.” In the early days, a treatment center in Florida could give legitimacy to a fake listing just by renting a post office box to receive the security code. Google eventually got wise to that, so scammers switched to private mailbox rentals, people’s houses, and “virtual office” services. </p>


<p id="kDuPRF">Scammers in other industries try to game AdWords and Google business listings, too. Google has to contend with lead generators for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html">locksmiths</a> and other businesses pretending to be a specific company near the searcher’s location, and fraudsters have used AdWords for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.luno.com%2Fblog%2Fen%2Fpost%2Fgoogle-ads-phishing-scams-identify-avoid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">phishing attempts,</a> keylogging malware, and <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/06/06/how-to-spot-potentially-scammy-ads-in-search-results/">tech</a> support <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/malicious-google-ad-pointed-millions-to-fake-windows-support-scam/#ftag=RSSbaffb68">scams</a>.</p>


<p id="lGDmOV">Some security experts complain that the company’s response to scams, especially those using Google Maps business listings, is glacially slow. For instance, in 2014, security expert Bryan Seely hijacked the phone numbers on Google Maps business listings for <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/how-a-hacker-intercepted-fbi-and-secret-service-calls-w-1531334747">FBI and Secret Service</a> offices. A year later, when Google still hadn’t fixed the security flaw, he used the same technique to create a verified Maps listing for Edward Snowden’s office… inside the White House.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="bieCvY"><q>“A lot of it is just taking advantage of consumers who may not know any better.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="SCc3ul">Waddington told me he hasn’t seen any complaints from rehabs in the Google help forums recently, but said complaints tend to come in waves. “Hopefully this current downtime is a sign that Google has improved their ability to combat the issue,” he said, “but it could also just mean that drug rehab spammers have improved their ability to avoid detection. I feel Google has a long way to go in identifying and removing spam listings overall." He first saw complaints about business listing hijackings back in <a href="https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Spam-Policy/Spam-phone-number-update-requests/td-p/860095">February 2016</a>.</p>


<p id="bbyoWT">Last year, Google trialled a more proactive approach, according to Mike Blumenthal, a Google top contributor and co-founder of Local U, a conference series on internet marketing. Google often gives him early information on <a href="http://blumenthals.com/blog/2016/10/04/google-testing-advanced-verification-process-for-plumbers-locksmiths/">news about the search platform</a>. Businesses in a few select demographics had to verify their location, or be hidden from search results. It was evidently too clunky. In July, a Google representative told Blumenthal they would instead be “leveraging a behind-the-scenes approach to combat” fraud, requiring less work from the business owner.</p>


<p id="NBVcQi">“We use automated systems to detect for spam and fraud, but we tend not to share details behind our processes so as not to tip off spammers or others with bad intent,” the Google spokesperson told me by email. “We’ve significantly reduced fraud with treatment center listings on Google and are committed to continuing to eradicate this type of fraud on our platforms.”</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ybWeiu">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="G154tc">These kinds of rehab marketing techniques may seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon, but 16 years ago, the <a href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/addiction-affliction-6353572"><em>Miami New Times</em></a> published a story that, anachronisms aside, could have been published today. Michelle, desperate to get sober, dialed the first rehab number in the phonebook. The salesperson quickly vetted her insurance, oversold the amenities, and bought her a plane ticket. When she landed, “Michelle discovered a few minor surprises: there was no fitness center, the pool was actually an algae-clogged hazard, and her insurance company was billed $1,000 per day instead of $400.” </p>


<p id="88jacm">Like Ali, Michelle was searching at the height of desperation and latched onto whatever she saw first. In Michelle’s case, the number popped up first in the Yellow Pages because the treatment center owner had filed the rehab under an alphabetically optimized name, Aaron Alcohol Abuse Addiction Assessment Counseling. (Business name paperwork took a pretty surreal turn during this analogue SEO war. In 2004, a former Sea Winds exec named his new company <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTiffToPDF?storagePath=COR%5C2004%5C0210%5C10438461.Tif&amp;documentNumber=P04000025166">A ALCOHAAAAAL A + A ABUSE 24 HOUR AAAA ABLE HEPLINE AND COUNSELING CENTER, INC</a>; in 2011, The Watershed, the same treatment center juggernaut from my editor’s Google search, registered to do business as the letter <a href="http://dos.sunbiz.org/scripts/ficidet.exe?action=DETOWN&amp;docnum=G11000011159&amp;seq=000000001&amp;format=C&amp;name=THE%20WATERSHED%20TREATMENT%20PROGRAMS%2c%20INC%2e&amp;rdocnum=G06285700080&amp;rseq=000000001&amp;rformat=C&amp;rname=THE%20WATERSHED%20TREATMENT%20PROGRAMS%2c%20INC%2e">A</a>.)</p>

<p id="3zWk57">The internet opened the floodgates of opportunity for sketchy ad tactics. Since the mid-2000s, a hodgepodge of in-house and third-party marketers have been generating enormous call volumes via TV spots, radio ads, and thousands of carefully targeted websites. </p>


<p id="TKj7kH">Third-party lead generators often send out “raw” calls in a kind of roulette, ringing a few times at each contracted treatment center until someone picks up. Much more valuable is a “verification of benefits” call, forwarded from a phone room that pre-vets addicts’ insurance policies.</p>


<p id="732uNK">Some companies are startlingly blunt in describing their services. Take Treatment Link, a shop out of Pompano Beach, Florida, which doesn't hide any details from prospective marketing clients.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="SVIbwY"><q>The Watershed registered to do business as the letter A</q></aside></div>


<p id="prCLkO">“All of our leads are <strong>exclusive, filtered, &amp; HOT!,” </strong>they exclaim on a page titled “<a href="http://treatmentlink.org/why-us/">Why We’re #1</a>.” They tout calls, generally <a href="http://www.alcoholismdrugabuseweekly.com/m-article-detail/treatment-centers-pay-lead-generator-up-to-1000-for-a-call-from-a-prospective-patient.aspx">the most expensive in the industry</a>, that are “qualified by our treatment specialists for cash payment or payment through an approved P.P.O network with <a href="http://treatmentlink.org">their insurance provider</a>.” </p>


<p id="W28YHU">Things are a little different over on Treatment Center Finder, the website Treatment Link uses to reel in addicts. “We provide treatment centers that guarantee your success,” they promise — a pretty wild claim, considering the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery">estimates that 40–60</a><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brain..."> percent</a> of addicts will relapse after rehab. “We will connect you with the drug rehab that will set you free from addiction, and lead you to a wonderful life beyond your dreams!” </p>


<p id="opMrFV">Some call center practices, in particular paying per-head bonuses for each admission, risk turning into <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catferguson/addiction-marketplace?utm_term=.krOzoOOe5Z#.roWbqKKG3E">patient brokering</a>, <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/sober-homes/">essentially buying and selling patients</a>. Common brokering practices include paying “junkie hunters” for clients; bribing patients with cash, drugs, and other incentives; and kicking back a portion of insurance reimbursements for blood, urine, or genetic testing. At its worst, patient brokering looks a lot like human trafficking, as addicts are <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/notorious-treatment-center-operator-chatman-gets-years-prison/erncUO4taKvkqkAB1dWHqL/">passed around between brokers, kept high, and even forced into prostitution. In Florida, it can be</a> a first-degree felony carrying a $500,000 fine. </p>


<p id="DZMf16">After a few years of buildup, Obamacare kicked the scams into high gear. Suddenly, anyone could get insurance covering addiction treatment — including drug tests that, with the help of a friendly medical professional, could turn one cup of urine into thousands of insurance dollars for rigorous chemical analyses. Professional groups generally recommend those tests only for confirming the results of suspicious or especially consequential pee-in-a-cup tests. </p>


<p id="mUuhW9">With exchange plans largely locked into paying for medically required tests, patients (and their urine) became gold mines. Some labs started offering kickbacks to treatment centers, who in turn began splitting the profits with halfway houses that would tempt clients with free rent and other services. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="EosIoL"><q>Patients (and their urine) became gold mines</q></aside></div>


<p id="q6HKp7">More and more halfway houses and treatment centers opened, flooding the market with businesses <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/county-billion-gold-rush-addiction-treatment-draws-fbi/JT3MyQwWckFyEZaSfQnoTN/">relying in large part</a> on trickle-down pee money. Street-level patient brokers and phone room lead generators stepped up to fill the beds with strategies across the ethical spectrum, including signing addicts up for Obamacare and paying their premiums. Some treatment center operators cut out the middleman by opening their own labs, which only increased the demand for new patients. </p>


<p id="PC4Omi">Almost every arrest by the Sober Homes Task Force has involved <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/crime--law/feds-delray-rehab-owner-arrested-billed-million-for-urine-tests/6GHtJ9zGgf953YfWc05SHL/">urinalysis overbilling</a> in one way or another. “Laboratory testing as a complement to clinical care may be routinely billed for without legitimate proof of medical necessity,” the task force wrote in a January report. “This is one of the engines that currently run the industry.” </p>


<p id="9hFEeX">In 2007, web marketer Phil Cory started TreatmentUSA as a kind of Yellow Pages for addiction recovery businesses. When he added an 800 number eight months later, more than one provider offered him thousands of dollars if he would vet patients’ insurance coverage ahead of time. He says he turned them down, sticking to selling raw calls off his 175 sites, and requiring centers to provide three appropriate phone numbers to people who didn’t have good insurance or the money to pay. He later sold the company to rehab chain American Addiction Centers.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="rXeeyV"><q>“This is one of the engines that currently run the industry.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="XCZmiM">“I could have made millions — multimillions — off the calls I generated for the treatment industry playing the same game as anyone else, but I made pennies on the dollar sticking to raw calls,” he told me wryly. “I went so far as to sell my company because the industry was getting horrific. There were bad actors coming into play and profiting ridiculously off of families, and that’s just not right.”</p>


<p id="fDuSRV">Cory and Johnson both say unethical marketers have made it incredibly hard for good providers to compete in the South Florida market. When your competitors are cheating, how do you stay honest and keep the door open? But now, they say, a reckoning has begun, and many treatment businesses are closing or fleeing the state.</p>


<div><aside id="tEDKsz"><q>“Where there’s high economic motivation, people figure out how to scam Google.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="IpBm4c">Insurance companies have stopped paying out for urine tests the way they used to, stepped up audits, and delayed some <a href="https://www.bna.com/cigna-sued-drug-n73014450314/">claims</a> to treatment providers. There have been over two dozen arrests of patient brokers in the <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/sober-home-task-force-score-one-fourth-already-have-pleaded-guilty/m7ckMuhrILeauu53zK6q5I/">last year or so</a>, based on investigations by a broad alliance of government agencies. The Sober Homes Task Force, where government officials are joined by industry stakeholders, has been helping push legislative change, such as this year’s law banning deceptive rehab marketing, which will eventually require marketers to register with the Florida government.</p>


<p id="6kVPcM">“It really boils down to — tell the truth. Disclose who you are, what services you provide, where you are. And if people do that, they won’t run afoul of the new law,” Johnson told me.</p>


<p id="VKgQxF">But addicts and scammers are both renewable resources, and even a combination of state laws, high-profile arrests, and algorithmic tweaks can only go so far when there’s money on the table and inventive cheaters to rake it in.</p>


<p id="n736HX">“The hackers have gotten better, Google’s gotten better,” Google blogger Blumenthal told me. “Where there’s high economic motivation, people figure out how to scam Google.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="bPQWsx">When Ali clicked on Aid in Recovery’s website, she found reassurance that their “knowledgeable and skilled admissions coordinators” would walk her through everything, and “create a customized treatment plan” just for her. “We do this by matching your specific needs with the best rehabs across the nation,” the page said until the marketing bill was passed.</p>


<p id="YtcPte">“The only thing they could say they did to match my needs was make sure the insurance would cover it,” Ali told me. </p>


<p id="L42xxA">Aid in Recovery employs clinicians, but the people who answer the phone generally aren’t licensed medical professionals. One of their primary qualifications is often having lived with addiction themselves. Hiring addicts in recovery to sell rehabs (not to mention <a href="http://fraservalleynewsnetwork.com/2016/12/27/street-hopes-new-and-used-becomes-goods-at-the-hoods-vintages-and-antiques/">antiques</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/13/12-steps-to-profit-building-a-60m-business-with-those-in-recovery.html">printer ink</a>, <a href="http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-09-2012/confessions-of-a-con-artist.html">gold coins</a>, and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/20/dream-vacations-turned-timeshare-nightmares.html">fake timeshares</a>) makes a lot of sense for both parties. Heavy drug users tend to accumulate points against them in the job market, like tattoos, track marks, criminal records, and long gaps in their resumes. But the desperation of long-term addiction can hone a certain genius for persuasion, too — a valuable skillset in the sales world.</p>


<p id="LPZEMW">When Ali called, the woman who answered knew just what to say to get her onto a plane. “She talked about how I needed to do this for my family, and that waiting would only make it more likely that things would get worse,” Ali told me. “I got scared.”</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="U8Qgth"><q>“I got scared.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="i3h4zn">To get the hard sell myself, I tried Aid in Recovery’s live chat a handful of times before the new marketing law, mostly asking about treatment for a heroin-addicted daughter. Asking for a list of treatment centers was a nonstarter, as was getting information about what kind of financial deals they have with the treatment centers. The more questions I asked, the more aggressive the salespeople got. On one chat, the marketer told me her own mother had just overdosed on IV heroin and died, so she knew what I was going through. When that didn’t sell me on giving her my personal information, she pulled out all the stops.</p>


<p id="sU4d5l">“I don’t know what would stop you from wanting to speak with a specialist to get further information,” she wrote. “The more paranoid you are the longer it’s going to take to get your daughter the help she needs.”</p>


<p id="mqYDFh">In their letter responding to my detailed questions, Treatment Management Company said, “At the time we started Aid in Recovery, we marketed it as an independent company since we often had to refer clients out for detoxification.”</p>


<p id="A09uuF">“Over time, we have developed a full service offering of medical detoxification services, residential treatment, outpatient services, after care services and limited toxicology services. Because we currently offer full treatment offerings and as state laws and regulations have evolved, we now disclose on our AIR website, and in our calls with patients, that AIR is affiliated with our treatment facilities.”</p>


<p id="YBrnbe">The site does now say that they are affiliated with centers in Florida, Arizona, and California, and they’ll say it on the phone, although they’re much more cagey in the live chat. According to public records, Deering, the owner of Aid in Recovery, has started or purchased the following rehab brands: Treasure Coast Recovery, Wellness Counseling and Residential Detox, and Executive Recovery Center, also known as The Lukens Institute, in Florida; Mountainside Recovery Center, also known as West Coast Wellness Center, in California; and Serenity Care Centers, Red Rock Wellness Care Centers, and Red Rock Addiction &amp; Treatment Company in Arizona. </p>


<div><aside id="R7sR9F"><q>Before July, everything about Aid in Recovery’s presentation suggested it was an unbiased referral service</q></aside></div>


<p id="4HQdqv">He is also the owner of National Laboratories, which specializes in drug tests for rehabs. It’s a legal arrangement — as long as they don’t bill Medicare or Medicaid, both of which ban practitioners from referring to labs with the same owner, or to labs owned by a family member.</p>


<p id="4oow0e">Treatment Management Company, according to a statement, provides administrative support, but does not control any of the companies. </p>


<p id="jRo08g">Since the marketing bill passed, Aid in Recovery has toned down the aggressiveness of their website copy some, changing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606184359/https://aidinrecovery.com/out-of-state-rehabs-vs-in-state/">“in-state versus out of state” page</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606184359/https:/..."> to remove</a> both a statement about how a local treatment center can’t prevent gossip or “people seeing who enters and leaves the facility,” and the incorrect claim that “it has been proven that the success rate is higher when one receives their treatment from rehab out of state.” (It may actually be worse, since <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11469-016-9712-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">family participation</a> improves the likelihood you’ll finish a given program.)</p>


<p id="ORjue6">Before July, though, everything about Aid in Recovery’s presentation suggested it was an unbiased referral service. Its employee email signatures, for example, had this disclaimer: “<strong>Aid in Recovery, LLC is a placement service...</strong>our advice does not constitute medical advice or diagnosis...substance abuse treatment services recommended by us are provided by independent treatment centers who are solely responsible for their content and for conformance with applicable [laws].” </p>


<p id="cyM3hq">I’ve reviewed a January copy of Wellness Counseling’s guidelines for how employees should handle patient discharges. Although the email disclaimers stated that Aid in Recovery wasn’t responsible for the services provided to Ali, and that no one from the company was giving her medical advice, the policy tells a different story. (Emphasis theirs.)</p>


<blockquote><p id="NcY1Fr">“All admits’ level of care and length of stay is [sic] predetermined by AIR and the [utilization review staff]...If a client leaves facility grounds (AWOL) and is gone for 2 hours or more, than the client shall be discharged. The client will need to call AIR and interview with the clinical director to be readmitted…If the client states he ‘was promised’ a shorter length of stay or alternate discharge plan, the case manager should call Aid in Recovery (AIR) <strong>WITHOUT THE CLIENT PRESENT</strong> and confirm the program commitment. If the patient committed to detox only or discharge to another facility outside of our system, then AIR will set up discharge plans with the client and coordinate transport. If the patient committed to a “full continuum of care”, then the case manager will ask the AIR counselor that worked with the client to assist with convincing client to follow through on commitment.” </p></blockquote>


<p id="8PN6oz">I spoke with a second former patient of Wellness, who left after insisting he had been promised a shorter stay. The staff more or less followed the guidelines, he told me. The techs listened to his Aid in Recovery recording (although he was around to hear it), and once they heard him say he only wanted detox, they let him go. </p>


<p id="OJxiKw">“Physicians at Wellness Counseling and other treatment facilities make their own independent determinations regarding the appropriate treatment plan and length of stay,” Treatment Management Company wrote in a statement. “Any statements to the contrary are false and defamatory.”</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jOnTuC">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="s7vDfB">Treatment Management Company has done a lot of growing up in the months since Ali called Aid in Recovery. Earlier this year, it expanded into Georgia, snagging a <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/03/31/treatment-center-operator-relocating-hq-to-atlanta.html">17,000-square-foot office space</a>, and this summer it finally got its own website, two years after getting a Florida business license. The site says the company has 31 treatment center locations across seven brands, and a “24/7 addiction hotline.” No brand names are given.</p>


<p id="CFiMjL">When I asked a Treatment Management Company spokesperson how business practices have changed in response to legislation and the company’s growth, he responded by email, saying, “A detailed timeline isn’t possible. Internal policies, laws and regulations in three states have continually changed over the years. We have always been compliant with laws and regulations.”</p>


<p id="jE7hoM">Deering got into rehabs in 2012, when he bought Treasure Coast Recovery, a rehab in Stuart, Florida. A year later, he bought a controlling interest in The Lukens Institute, a luxury rehab run by clinical psychologist Michael Lukens, and started Aid in Recovery to market them both. Multiple former employees who worked with Aid in Recovery independently told me Deering called clients “gold bars.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="cnFhAD"><q>Multiple former employees said Deering called clients “gold bars”</q></aside></div>


<p id="VM7Nvf">Asked about the “gold bars” comments, Treatment Management Company offered the following explanation: “The term ‘gold bars’ was invented by managers so that our phone reps understand that each person calling in is suffering from the ravages of addiction and needs to quickly get to treatment. Sadly, we sometimes spent hours getting approvals and we weren’t always moving fast enough to get back to people who had their bags packed so they could start their journey to recovery. Managers urged our phone reps to think of each client as a ‘gold bar’ that we wouldn’t let out of our sight until safe and sound – whether to one of our facilities or another facility where they could get the help they need.”</p>


<p id="5qiuIo">Deering brought on Lindsay Lohan’s press-hungry father, Michael Lohan, to market his new companies. “Inspired by his faith, Michael Lohan has decided to open the nation’s first faith based clinical treatment center,” a Lukens Institute <a href="http://courantblogs.com/colin-mcenroe/radio-guest-pitch-of-the-day/">press release</a> said at the time. It was the second time God called to Lohan; in 2010, he claimed he was moving to Los Angeles to start a faith-based rehab, as well. </p>


<p id="ms2rt4">Lohan’s press strategy for Aid in Recovery seems to have been centered around trashy headlines, including telling tabloids he wished <a href="http://www.wptv.com/news/region-n-palm-beach-county/palm-beach-gardens/lindsay-lohan-rehab-michael-lohan-wants-daughter-to-rehab-at-lukens-institute-in-palm-beach-gardens">his daughter</a> would go to the Lukens Institute. <a href="http://www.today.com/popculture/teen-mom-star-enters-luxury-rehab-center-michael-lohans-recommendation-6C10504738"><em>Teen Mom</em> star Farrah Abraham</a> also went to the rehab, as did the “Tan Mom” <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/tan-mom-patricia-krentcil-enters-rehab-article-1.1379880">Patricia Krentcil</a>. All three D-listers were <a href="http://www.wptv.com/news/region-n-palm-beach-county/palm-beach-gardens/lindsay-lohan-rehab-michael-lohan-wants-daughter-to-rehab-at-lukens-institute-in-palm-beach-gardens">reportedly</a> repped by PR agent Gina Rodriguez, who didn’t respond to a request for comment. Treatment Management Company told me no patients have ever been paid to go to one of their rehabs.</p>


<p id="5lej0L">In late 2014, Lohan, who has also worked with several <a href="http://gawker.com/5897560/pr-dummies-michael-lohan-is-pretty-much-the-worst">treatment center</a><a href="http://gawker.com/5897560/pr-dummies-michael-lohan...">s</a> in South Florida unaffiliated with Deering or Treatment Management Company, told <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/11/michael-lohan-rehab-lindsay-florida-drugs-alcohol-exclusive/"><em>Radar</em></a> he was fed up with crime in the South Florida recovery scene. “Such treatment centers turn a person’s dream into a nightmare,” he reportedly told the gossip rag. </p>


<p id="3XbrtQ">Lukens left the company right around when <em>Radar</em> published that story, because of what he calls “philosophical, moral, and ethical differences between us.” He told me that patients would regularly come to the Lukens Institute and say someone in the phone room had lied to them about the program and its offerings. “Nobody said, ‘Bryan told us to lie,’ but I went to him about it and complained, and it didn’t stop. So, he was either unable or unwilling to stop it,” Lukens said. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="U5Aj02"><q>“He was either unable or unwilling to stop it.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="WFcJxV">According to Lukens, he made a deal that Deering would buy out his stake over the course of two years and then stop using The Lukens Institute name, which Lukens has trademarked. The psychologist maintains the deal has not been honored. “I took my toys and tried to go home, and he kept some of my toys,” Lukens told me. </p>


<p id="4dNpNr">When I called the number on The Lukens Institute website, the answering service still said “Welcome to the Lukens Institute.” When I pressed three for the clinical director, I got the voicemail for Executive Recovery’s director, and when I pressed one for more information, I got Aid in Recovery, who told me their programs were “similar to Lukens, of course, but he has his own thing, mostly self-pay.” The Lukens Institute logo appears on at least one Aid in Recovery website, as well. Treatment Management Company maintains the parting was “amicable” and that the purchase agreement allows for the use of the name. </p>


<p id="ek76VN">About a year after leaving, Lukens made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeBSVc3bDr8">video echoing Lohan’s sentiment</a>, criticizing the industry at large, including the “unscrupulous and sometimes criminal activity” of some treatment center owners. </p>


<p id="z6pLdf">“I actually have perspective from behind the scenes — by and large, the mentality of the owner-operator is continuously putting profits ahead of people, so very little attention is paid to improving the quality of care over time. It’s as if they realize there’s no money in it,” he deadpans, with a college professor’s resigned irony. </p>


<p id="lWj9MM">“The FBI is quite interested in this industry, and they’re looking to crack down on some of these practices, and I support that wholeheartedly — I hope they clean up some of the mess here.”</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qpxuNF">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="e3IbMD">“I told her my life story,” Ali said of the woman who answered her first phone call. “She listened, and confirmed all my feelings, you know? She validated me.” Ali says the rep told her it wouldn’t cost anything out of pocket. She has yet to receive a bill from the company. </p>


<p id="UtDrdB">The salesperson took down Ali’s insurance, and promised to call back. The next morning, an Aid in Recovery rep called to book her a flight to Wellness, a treatment center that matched her needs. Shortly after, she got an email asking her to confirm she could fly with her health conditions; once she’d sent that, she got an email with her flight information, which put her in Florida by dinner. She barely had time to pack. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="2o8pkx"><q>She barely had time to pack</q></aside></div>


<p id="foJ79f">It’s common for treatment centers in Florida to offer prospective leads inducements like plane tickets and waiver of co-pays and coinsurance, generally having patients sign a promissory note to pay them back. The notes theoretically prevent the plane tickets from being a violation of Florida’s anti patient-brokering laws. </p>


<p id="khHcZL">Although Ali’s credit card was charged for her plane ticket, the other patient I spoke with had Aid in Recovery buy his ticket. He signed a promissory note, though he told me he didn’t feel pressure to pay it back. According to former employees who worked with Aid in Recovery in its first two years, phone room salespeople were paid monthly performance bonuses. One told me they were paid based both on how many patients they brought in, and on other metrics, such as convincing patients to pay for their own flights. </p>


<p id="7l799E">(A recent job listing for Aid in Recovery lists the following responsibilities: “Sell a certain program based on the insurance, available resources, age, gender, and medical needs...Be prepared to ask client if they’re able to contribute any money for either their flight, money on top of an insurance policy or to pay an out of pocket expense...Transfer the client to a client care coordinator to book a flight.”)</p>


<p id="BddBnL">Both patients feel Aid in Recovery over-promised what Wellness offered. They both spent about a week in detox and then moved to the rehab, a motel that had been converted a month or two before. The patients were co-ed, ranging from teenagers to the elderly. Ali and the other patient told me they were at Wellness with an old man with diabetes and a walker. They also told me people with widely divergent needs were mostly treated through group therapy sessions.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="XsaUfV"><q>They described the atmosphere at Wellness as disorganized and understaffed</q></aside></div>


<p id="nkj9u8">The two patients I spoke with described the atmosphere at Wellness as disorganized and understaffed, having just opened a few weeks before. Shortly before the man left, the treatment center sent a large group of people to the Executive Recovery Center, which does intensive outpatient while putting clients up in sober living houses. The patient, who told me his only drug use was alcohol, stayed behind, eager to get out of there. </p>


<p id="1Hr9yM">“I learned about more drugs than I’d ever learned about in my life,” he told me. “The people that were doing drugs were <em>chain</em> smoking. They said they were smoking about five times what they normally smoked, because there was nothing to do.” While he told me he wants the company to be held accountable for their deception, he wasn’t comfortable publicly discussing his stint in rehab, so I agreed not to use his name. </p>


<p id="y81xqw">Individual therapy wasn’t much better. Ali wasn’t sure the center assigned therapists at all; the man thought he <em>had </em>an assigned therapist, he just wasn’t sure who it <em>was.</em> Several therapists talked to him during his time there, he recalls, mostly finding him on the outside patio and joining him for a chat.<em> </em></p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="boYym6"><q>“I learned about more drugs than I’d ever learned about in my life.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="gKk5Hp">“They’d just did it nonchalantly, it wasn’t like they called us into a room and talked to us,” he told me. Walking up to someone in a public area and asking how they’re doing is not a standard therapeutic technique. </p>


<p id="1oTCZo">“The center meets and exceeds all staff to patient ratios set by the state of Florida,” Treatment Management Company said in their statement. “Counseling sessions – individual and group – are provided [in detox] but the focus in these critical early days of recovery is on treating the physical symptoms of withdrawal.”</p>


<p id="yIer0o">Ali’s insurance was charged significant amounts for urinalysis throughout her stay. Three times — Ali’s first and last days in detox, and her second day in the rehab facility — Wellness Counseling and Detox billed her insurance $3,615 for a urine test, while <a href="https://national-labs.com/">National Laboratories</a>, owned by Deering, billed her insurance $6,800 for so-called definitive testing of at least eight drugs. Medicare rates for the tests are $79.81 and $155.42, respectively. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="rojkHN"><q>Ali’s insurance was billed $74,785 for 11 days</q></aside></div>


<p id="xZEwtw">In total, between Wellness, National Laboratories, and the medical providers who billed separately, Ali’s insurance was billed $74,785 for 11 days: $40,605 for four days in detox, and $34,180 for a week in the residential treatment center. Her insurance company reimbursed them $22,046.37, about a third of what the providers requested, according to Ali’s explanations of benefits.</p>


<p id="72tMbG">“The [drug] test done at Wellness upon admission provides limited information to begin treatment, and comes back within a couple of hours. If the doctor needs more detailed information on the exact drugs and levels in the patient’s system, he orders a confirmation test at National Laboratories,” Treatment Management Company said, referring to their general practices, which are not illegal.</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Rpw092">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="HsMfos">Ali had been at Wellness Counseling for about a week when she got sick.</p>


<p id="cWDrID">Ali has gastroschisis, a rare birth defect involving the intestines and, often, other organs. She has to be careful about what she eats, has an implanted defibrillator, and regularly spends time in the ER for painful, even life-threatening abdominal problems.</p>


<p id="t9r4pE">Wellness Counseling doesn’t have an on-site doctor, and Florida doesn’t require them to, although the Sober Homes Task Force bill instructs the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to draft stiffer regulations by the beginning of 2018. Wellness’ medical director, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdr-jeffrey-bishop-61359b78%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jeffrey Bishop</a>, is an osteopathic physician who uses his internet presence to shill for a multi-level marketing company that sells “Natural Weight Management Coffee...Also a very effective Immune Drink.” Medical care was provided by a nurse practitioner who came to Wellness once a day. </p>


<p id="Jniegs">On January 20th, Ali told staff that she was having stomach pain. One staff member suggested a painkiller that would have made the situation more dangerous, according to Ali. Upset by the interaction, she went back to her room. Then she realized she was having a medical emergency and went back to the front office for help, but was told she would have to wait. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="c0cssm"><q> She began demanding a phone to call 911</q></aside></div>


<p id="Xd2jGa">Increasingly anxious about her pain, she began demanding a phone to call 911, she recalls, but no one would let her use one. Several hours after her symptoms began, the staff finally called her an ambulance.</p>


<p id="MGQQLX">When she finally got to the hospital on Saturday night, she was determined not to end up back at Wellness. Thankfully, she didn’t require major medical intervention, and convinced her discharge nurse to refer her to another treatment center, but their admissions office was closed until Monday. Exhausted, miserable, angry, and alone, not sure where she was, and with all her money and clothes back at the rehab, she picked a random direction and started walking.  </p>


<p id="U1vypW">She happened to walk by the sheriff's station, where a deputy agreed to help her retrieve her belongings. After several hours of chaos and frustration at Wellness, she got some of her stuff, including her cellphone and enough money to buy a plane ticket, and called a car to take her to the airport, she recalls. But the staff gave her something else by accident: the guidelines for staff members discharging patients. That was the first time she found out Aid in Recovery was more than just a referral company.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="nSJCrw"><q>She picked a random direction and started walking  </q></aside></div>


<p id="yrXkNX">“When I saw the name Aid in Recovery on that paperwork, it shocked me,” she said. Back home in Texas, Ali began looking into the company.</p>


<p id="v817Qm">She contacted every local, state, and federal agency she could think of, but it didn’t do much good. She filed three reports with the Department of Children and Families, which polices treatment centers in Florida, but each time, they would immediately close the case, she recalls. It wasn’t until she complained to the Office of the Inspector General that DCF undertook a formal investigation. </p>


<p id="zV3UtD">An inspector visited the site, spoke to one patient, several Treatment Management Company executives, and reviewed a variety of documents, including Ali’s medical records. She determined there was no wrongdoing by Wellness in a report that referred to the treatment center as “Wellington Counseling &amp; Residential Detoxification Services” throughout.</p>


<p id="vQHnYv">DCF is, according to both people in the industry and in law enforcement, underfunded and otherwise ill-equipped to police thousands of treatment centers and halfway houses. A December grand jury report found the agency had <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-sober-home-legislation-20161214-story.html">25 licensing specialists for 931</a> licensed rehabs. And until the last legislative session, which ended in May, they barely had the ability to punish treatment centers operating without a license, let alone those that break some rules and stick to others. </p>


<p id="iR4GAM">As of July 1st, the agency is getting more cash from licensing fees, and has the power to immediately suspend a treatment center’s license. Operating without a license is now a third-degree felony, and background checks are now required for owners, directors, and clinical supervisors. </p>


<div><aside id="QD3pYe"><q>“When I saw the name Aid in Recovery on that paperwork, it shocked me.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="xq00Sm">These changes come after years of media and community pressure to clean up the industry. The Sober Homes Task Force finally broke legal ground late last year, with the first <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/sober-home-task-force-score-one-fourth-already-have-pleaded-guilty/m7ckMuhrILeauu53zK6q5I/">arrests of treatment center owners and operators</a> who were allegedly involved in patient brokering schemes. Dozens more have since been arrested, <a href="http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/sober-home-task-force-score-one-fourth-already-have-pleaded-guilty/m7ckMuhrILeauu53zK6q5I/">around a quarter of whom have pled guilty.</a></p>


<p id="bTwkA9">The Task Force also wrote most of the language in the deceptive marketing bill, which requires marketers to register with the state and creates penalties for lying about treatment programs. Johnson, state attorney and head of the task force, said the deadline and many of the details are still up in the air, but the <a href="http://forms.freshfromflorida.com/10008.pdf">application</a> gives a sense of the scope. Marketing companies will have to give a full accounting of parent and holding companies, subsidiaries, and associated corporations, as well as a complete list of owners, business partners, trustees, shareholders, officers, and office managers, so the state can run background checks looking for fraud, embezzlement, and other relevant felonies. </p>


<p id="feKrjt">Both of the bill’s sponsors believe explicitly banning many of the tricks marketers use to lure addicts to Florida will result in fewer patients coming in from out of state. That’s a big deal, considering approximately 75 percent of the current patient population in South Florida is from elsewhere.</p>


<p id="rmtV7X">Although this is movement in the right direction, Johnson had a word of caution about the law’s reach. “These are guidelines,” he told me. “It’s up to the state and the industry to police ... The goal is to get back to an equilibrium where there’s good treatment, as opposed to these rogue operators.”</p>


<p id="Cb2NcG">Ali, at least, found the treatment she needed, back home in Texas. She got a referral to a local treatment center from her psychiatrist — she’s learned her lesson about calling numbers on the internet — and completed two back-to-back recovery programs. She’s still sober, and now has to learn to navigate the world as an addict in recovery, with all the stigma that entails.</p>


<p id="D8OGmr">“I now belong to a different community of people, who don’t have the same protection — that nobody fights for,” Ali told me.  </p>


<p id="dgrjLo">Laws may be changing, and a market correction may be underway, but that means more pressure and less money in an already oversaturated industry. “The next 18 months is gonna be the telltale sign,” Cory, who started TreatmentUSA, told me. “You’re going to see a lot of these [rehabs], especially in South Florida and California, shut their doors because they’re not profitable.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="jCFS0n"><q>Size doesn’t make a company immune to the industry’s tarnish</q></aside></div>


<p id="VkqPBt">At the same time, treatment center conglomerates are <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/18/addiction-treatment-the-new-gold-rush-its-almost-chic/">growing more and more common</a>, taking advantage of the fiscal benefits of efficient, centralized decision-making and resource-sharing. But size <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/08/25/behind-luxury-turmoil-and-shoddy-care-inside-five-star-addiction-treatment-centers/HzNBLYyMCIjSkaKyUZgfSN/story.html">doesn’t make a company immune to the industry’s tarnish</a>. Two of the largest rehab groups in the country — Elements Behavioral Health and American Addiction Centers — have been accused of unethical behavior, including hiring scammy marketing companies to steal Google <a href="https://www.behavioral.net/article/one-ceo-attacks-bait-and-switch-marketing-tactics">business listings</a>, though both disavowed the marketers’ actions. </p>


<p id="xh5uzb">Subsidiaries of both <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/788672/unitedhealth-says-lab-test-kickback-scheme-cost-it-50m">Elements</a> and <a href="http://www.treatmentmagazine.com/newswires/442-addiction-treatment-urine-testing-fraud-jim-bevell-american-addiction-centers.html">AAC</a> have been accused of participating in urine test kickback schemes, while facilities owned by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-rehab-murder-charge-20160228-story.html">AAC</a> and two other chains, <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/033114_sierra_tucson/investigators-point-shortfalls-after-sierra-tucson-suicide/">CRC Health Group</a> and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/08/25/behind-luxury-turmoil-and-shoddy-care-inside-five-star-addiction-treatment-centers/HzNBLYyMCIjSkaKyUZgfSN/story.html">Recovery Centers of America</a>, have been accused of maintaining lax standards of care that contributed to patient deaths. Former call center employees at the AAC facility told the <em>LA Times</em> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-rehab-murder-charge-20160228-story.html">the sales environment was high-pressure</a>, and all about getting heads in beds. Several staff members, including the former president of AAC, were indicted on murder charges, later dismissed.</p>


<p id="TSnyAH">All four companies denied or failed to respond to journalists’ questions about the above allegations.</p>


<p id="DQ712P">At the moment, conglomerates control just a small part of the US market, but industry observers predict a steady increase in consolidation. All that money seems to be bringing with it a new kind of smooth-talking salesman: pharmaceutical reps.</p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="taxmvz">“A lot of these venture capital firms are coming in and buying percentages, or whole treatment centers, and changing the salesforce from the marketing call centers into a pharmaceutical salesforce,” Bierman, executive director of Maryland Addiction Recovery Center, told me. “We had a guy in our office a month ago, and I asked him what he did before this. He said he sold Viagra.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ztZxA7">In the summer of 2015, Stan Transkiy was 16 years into a life sentence, and he had finally found a way to occupy his time. Inside the Marion Correctional Institution, which sits on green farmland off a series of quiet roads in rural Ohio, he had carved out a job running a recycling program, a gig that earned him nicknames like “The Garbage Man.” It was an apt description: Transkiy, bald and bearded, sometimes worked 14 hours straight and sorted, by his estimate, tens of thousands of pounds of trash over the years. He did the job well, according to an inmate job evaluation, even if he sometimes took work problems too personally.</p>


<p id="uzHAAt">Marion was an improvement over Transkiy’s previous facility, Lebanon Correctional Institution. State inspectors had <a href="http://ciic.state.oh.us/docs/Marion%20Correctional%20Institution%202015.pdf">lauded Marion for </a>“innovative thinking” that “infuses the environment.” In addition to the recycling initiative, the prison ran programs in education, aquatics, news, and gardening. It even hosted a TEDx event — part of a series of talks that, in 2013, <a href="http://blog.ted.com/orange-is-the-new-black-piper-kerman-tedx-talk/">drew <em>Orange </em><em>I</em><em>s the New Black </em>author Piper Kerman</a> to speak alongside inmates and staff and eventually offer writing lessons in the facility. </p>


<p id="0iiv9g">One day in August, Transkiy heard a voice boom over the prison intercom asking for Randy Canterbury, an employee at an outside nonprofit called RET3 who oversaw the prison’s recycling initiative. One by one, Transkiy watched as men he worked closely with were called into mysterious interviews with prison and state authorities. Someone was looking into wrongdoing tied to the recycling program. </p>


<p id="0R0bAe">Soon, Transkiy himself was called into an office, where state investigators grilled him. <em>Did he know Canterbury’s computer password? Did he understand how firewalls work? Would he take a polygraph?</em> Staff threw him into a segregated section of the prison called O Block, and when he was called back to the office nine days later, a state trooper questioned him as a phone rang in the background. “Obviously, Stan, the whole computer situation, you’re aware of that,” the trooper said, according to a transcript of the conversation. “You’re aware they were found.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="xYUhTJ"><q>“This is... this is... this is bullshit basically.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="LWu5FQ">Transkiy was being questioned about an extraordinary form of contraband. Someone had hidden refurbished computers in the ceiling of the prison. They’d somehow obtained a login to the prison’s network, gaining access to the inner workings of the facility, including databases on inmates and the tools for creating passes needed to enter restricted areas. The computers also granted access to the outside world, which someone had used to apply for credit cards using the stolen identity of a prisoner. The scheme extended from the prison, to a community nonprofit, to multiple banks — all done under the noses of an oblivious prison staff. When investigators laid out the contours of the plot, Transkiy said he couldn’t believe it. “This is... this is... this is bullshit basically,” he stammered out. “This is something, you know, that’s... that’s... that’s not real.” </p>


<p id="9fwgGo">When the results of the state’s investigation became public in April of this year, the state inspector general <a href="http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/investigation-finds-inmates-built-computers-and-hid-them-in-ceiling-at-marion-prison">compared the incident</a> to <em>Hogan’s Heroes</em>, with prison staff acting in the role of the incompetent, outmaneuvered overseers. While there’s an element of truth to the characterization, interviews with inmates, investigators, and staff, as well as written correspondence and thousands of pages of previously unpublished public records, also reveal a complex crime requiring considerable technical savvy. Together, they show how a progressive facility had difficulty implementing and securing technology that provided novel opportunities for learning, as well as mischief. “Our inmates are way smarter than our technical people, you know,” one investigator later said during an interrogation. “So we’ve got a huge problem there.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="1ujkWo">Transkiy worked on the recycling program alongside two talented colleagues, Scott Spriggs and Adam Johnston, who’d spent time together inside Lebanon. Spriggs and Johnston were close friends. Spriggs explained that both were incarcerated at 18, in the early 2000s, and their crimes and sentences were similar: murder and related charges that meant a minimum of decades behind bars, perhaps their entire lives. Both showed a magnetic attraction to computers and shared a reserved demeanor, Spriggs told me. “Zen” was the word Transkiy used to describe Johnston. “Very few things bother him,” he said. </p>


<p id="qNhS9X">Johnston, a fit, light-haired man convicted of <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/ohio/second-district-court-of-appeals/2002/2002-ohio-3295.html">a brutal drug-linked murder</a>, was an avid reader, and his personal tastes skewed toward genre. In <a href="http://www.writeaprisoner.com/Template.aspx?i=z-414233">an online pen pal profile</a>, he wrote that he loved reading sci-fi and fantasy, especially <em>Game of Thrones</em>. He’d played the guitar for about 20 years, and developed an interest in astronomy and philosophy. He also stayed in contact with his mother, Karen Gallienne.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="oZtYpo"><q>“You done started a shit storm, woman, huh?”</q></aside></div>


<p id="ZyUtry">Gallienne lived two hours away, in a quiet neighborhood outside Dayton, and visited the prison regularly. By 2015, Johnston had been in prison for 15 years, but called home frequently, affectionately referring to his mother as “woman.” After she told Johnston over the phone how she had intervened in an episode of familial drama, he told her, “You done started a shit storm, woman, huh?” Other times, they’d reminisce: on one call, Gallienne recalled seeing fish tanks inmates kept at the prison, and watching one fish attempt an escape, leaping out of the tank and flopping on the floor helplessly.</p>


<p id="ah4Cm0">Johnston and Spriggs both had prior technical experience from their time together at Lebanon. Spriggs went through a training course in C and C++. He also learned database creation and worked on manual data entry for clients like the AFL-CIO, who contracted with the prison through an outside company. With some of the other skills he learned in lockup, he built a program to clean up damaged sound files and, later, made an image-retrieval system for a Georgia sheriff’s office. </p>

<p id="RUroqu">Johnston, Spriggs says, learned Visual Basic — something simple to start, although both seemed to quickly improve at their crafts. Spriggs eventually became the server and network administrator with a prison program, and helped build new computers for the IT department, which gave him a mastery over hardware as well. According to one inmate’s statement, the two also had a side business, burning and selling mysteriously purloined CDs with video games or porn. (Spriggs denies this, and Johnston didn’t respond to letters.) When the two weren’t programming, they would cook or work out together. “Both of us were looking to learn whatever we could that would help us if we were ever to go home,” Spriggs told me.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><div id="wJC3iQ"><div></div></div></div>


<p id="ZEpp5y">Prison authorities are, at best, ambivalent about inmates’ access to technology, but facilities are now experimenting with computer education programs and even limited internet access. In recent years, there’s been a sea change in approaches, according to <a href="https://www.edpubs.gov/document/ed005580p.pdf">a 2015 Department of Education report</a>, which highlighted Ohio’s particularly forward-looking policy. Corrections departments are finally seeing how computers are vital tools for education, and increasingly essential for inmates hoping to make a clean return to society, although concerns about security persist. </p>


<p id="xwzu3Q">Marion’s Green Initiative, which encompassed programs like gardening and aquaculture, looked like a shining example of a progressive prison curriculum. Transkiy ran recycling, Johnston was treasurer, and Spriggs worked on IT. </p>


<p id="qhHxfx">“This prison isn’t like what you see on TV or in the movies,” the warden, a former social worker, said onstage at the 2012 TEDx event, casually dressed in shorts and a green polo. “Its staff are different. Its men in blue are different.” He said that he joined Marion to make it “cutting-edge.” If the higher-ups didn’t like it, he reasoned, they could fire him. The prison had recently completed 509,000 hours of community service in a year. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="H0Wkn2"><q>“This prison isn’t like what you see on TV or in the movies.... Its staff are different. Its men in blue are different.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="9g2RHV">The facility partnered with nonprofits like RET3, which worked with inmates to pull apart old computers, then organize and send back the sorted pieces. Inmates in the program were also instructed to look for high-end, salvageable machines that could be reused inside Marion. Sometimes, though, electronics were used for unsanctioned purposes. Spriggs and Transkiy say SD cards loaded with porn were somehow smuggled in so the explicit videos could be secretly played on a Nintendo Wii. Inmates had thumb drives loaded with porn and entertainment like newly released movies, and rented out access to the files. At one point, as a former staff member at the facility remembered it, inmates set up a showing of <em>The Fast and the Furious </em>— not an older entry in the series, but one that had just been released in theaters. </p>


<p id="7WKZTw">It’s not uncommon for a prison to have its own black market micro-economy, even if Marion’s seemed especially vibrant. But the desktops stashed in the ceiling were an order of magnitude above thumb drives and CDs, as investigators were soon to discover. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="LBr1kV">On July 3rd, 2015, the corrections department’s newly installed electronic security system sent out an alert to the support team. A computer using the login “canterburyrl” — the login for RET3’s Randy Canterbury — was exceeding its usage limits. Over the next few days, the situation became more concerning. “On Friday afternoon I received 7 hacking alerts for the user (canterburyrl) as well as 59 proxy avoidance alerts,” an IT staff member wrote in an email to the department’s CIO on July 6th. The user had spent hours going through flagged sites, like file-sharing services, and attempted to avoid detection through proxies.</p>


<p id="WuvRy7">The exact location of the user was a mystery, though, and so was the operator. Canterbury, who declined to comment for this story, wasn’t difficult to eliminate as a suspect; he didn’t even work on Fridays, when the first alert came in. But it was hard to go much further until the state IT team, remotely assisting since the first security alert, came up with a name attached to the PC, which included the sequence “lab9.”</p>


<p id="JJ0UXX">When the computer name came in, Gene Brady, who worked in IT at Marion, immediately knew where to go. “There’s only one place in the institution I have PCs named in that fashion, and that is in the staff computer lab on the third floor,” he told investigators. But there were only six computers up there, not nine, like the naming convention suggested.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="bsrpGh"><q>Brady took an analog approach: following wires</q></aside></div>


<p id="qaE9BY">The third floor area known as P3 had a reputation at Marion. Some called it “the ivory tower,” which could have alluded to its status as a place for training, or the fact that it was sequestered. One black inmate told investigators that the real reason it earned that name was because “that’s all that was up there was the good-ol’ boys, or all of the white guys.”</p>


<p id="PLXDIA">But Brady couldn’t track down exactly where the offending computer was. Finally, the state IT team determined the switch and port the computer was plugged into. To find the offending machine, Brady took an analog approach: following wires.</p>


<p id="gqXoum">“We had pulled the cable and we started tracing the cable through the ceiling,” an inmate who had been recruited for the job told investigators. The network hub was a mass of wires — blue, orange, green — organized without any obvious reason. Brady traced one line to a part of the ceiling above a small training room closet. He pulled in a ladder and removed a tile from the drop ceiling. Inside, there was a Dell computer tower. Then he uncovered another. </p>


<p id="4zFjIn">Brady alerted the staff, and a lieutenant squeezed into the cramped space, snapping photos to document what they’d found. A couple of inmates pulled down the computers, and carted them away. Brady later told investigators that he didn’t realize just how troubling the discovery was. “It didn’t click for me that, oops, this might be a crime scene until after we had found everything,” he said. “And a couple days later, I went, ‘Ah, shit.’”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="1q4KVi">Staff spent the next few days going back and forth over what to do. An IT employee flagged the identification placards attached to the ceiling computers. One was from a local school district; another came from a company in the area.</p>


<p id="dvmuyS">It wasn’t until August 7th when the corrections department’s chief counsel, a man named Stephen Gray, was informed of the discovery. “When I found out about it, I said, ‘You know, there could have been some illegal activity associated with this ‘cause we don’t know what the inmates were doing,’” he said later. He drafted a notice to state investigators.</p>


<p id="6VvVw4">“You’ve got to be kidding me,” the state inspector general, Randall J. Meyer, remembers thinking when he read the note. Meyer was familiar with Marion Correctional. In 2014, the facility was at the center of a bizarre financial aid fraud scheme, in which someone had stolen inmates’ identities. Meyer appointed a field investigator, who worked on the case with the state’s highway patrol.  </p>


<p id="K5duva">A forensics team moved in to examine hardware in the facility. With a compromised network, the crime scene was huge. Investigators eventually seized hundreds of hard drives from Marion in the arduous process of documenting the prison’s computers. According to an email summary of one day’s work, they got through more than 50 before stopping at midnight. </p>

<p id="EwpQwd">Meanwhile, investigators spent weeks interviewing anyone who might have information about the computers, questioning everyone from inmates to the warden about where the computers came from, and who may have hidden them in the ceiling. If the investigation was proper in scope, however, there was sloppiness in its execution. Officials placed inmates under suspicion in segregation, but failed to segregate them from each other; Transkiy says he shared a cell with Johnston. In its publicly released summary, the investigators said they sent the inmates to new facilities when it “became apparent” they could still coordinate answers to interrogation questions. At one point, the team sealed off areas in the prison that may have held evidence, and informed the warden that they were not to be entered. A prison official went into the space anyway; the warden said they needed some files. </p>


<p id="MNkf5q">It was the forensics team that uncovered the most important clue. The computers hidden in the ceiling had everything an aspiring hacker could need: encryption tools, a version of the Tor browser, even tools for email spamming and password-cracking. But one program was paydirt: a desktop-to-text-message service. </p>


<p id="5Gornl">The texting service revealed conversations between Adam Johnston and Karen Gallienne. In one text, Gallienne sent Johnston an address, which Johnston told her “sounds really close to your house.” The forensics team also discovered the applications to banks for credit cards under the name Kyle Patrick, a prisoner in the Ohio system.  </p>


<p id="JdAPSs">Investigators turned to recordings of calls that Johnston had made to Gallienne from the prison. Combined with the contents of the computers, they painted a damning picture. On one call, Gallienne explained that she’d received a credit card rejection letter from Chase, as the applicant didn’t have an established credit history. “All right. I figured,” Johnston told her. “I’m figuring it out. Slowly but surely.” Later, a card for Kyle Patrick arrived, and Gallienne read off the numbers to her son.  </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="O5vygu">On a cool November day, four months after the discovery of the computers, investigators made their way to Gallienne’s home. State highway patrol officers searched the house, grabbing electronics and uncovering the credit card for Kyle Patrick. Then they sat down with Gallienne and Johnston’s brother, Jason. A highway patrol trooper led the questioning, and didn’t play coy about Johnston. “Obviously, through the course of our investigation it was found that you’ve been involved in aiding him with identify theft,” he said to Gallienne. “Were you aware of that?”</p>


<p id="xIt0RP">She denied it, saying Johnston had only sent the credit card “to try to help me.” He “sells stuff in there ‘cause he has equipment, guitars, just stuff like that,” she said. The card was only a way to send her some of that money. </p>


<p id="fHhZpq">All of that was “fine and dandy,” the trooper told her, but what about the name on the card, Kyle Patrick? “Why wouldn’t he put that card in your name?” he asked.</p>


<p id="YaDUR7">“Because he said that it would be bad to put it in my name.”</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="VkBAw0"><q>“Why wouldn’t he put that card in your name?” </q></aside></div>


<p id="LOJZ91">“And why would that be?”</p>


<p id="DkgMBj">Gallienne paused.</p>


<p id="r4CkvP">She explained that Johnston wouldn’t go into the detail, but she admitted to giving him the name and address of a neighbor, who wasn’t involved except as a place to deliver the mail. When the credit card came, she got it through him. All her son told her was “‘Don’t worry about it,’” she told the investigators. “That’s all he ever said. What am I supposed to do when he texts me? Just say don’t text me again? I mean, this is my son.”</p>


<p id="CxwZNw">As the interrogation went on, the investigators pushed harder. “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever been in trouble for?” the trooper asked. </p>


<p id="rilfRb">“Nothing,” Gallienne said. “I’ve never been in trouble.”</p>


<p id="35I1Xl">“No speeding tickets?”</p>


<p id="dYwW68">“Not since I was 16.” </p>


<p id="Pxugg4">“You know what identity theft and fraud is?”</p>


<p id="UXlMxF">“Yes, I do.” </p>


<p id="FLRZ1q">“Especially when it involves financial institutions?”</p>


<p id="MiBwtA">“Yes, I do. I’m sure it’s really bad.”</p>


<p id="ACiGZP">“And what is that? Would you say felony level?”</p>


<p id="opAGI8">“Probably.”</p>


<p id="Vu3adf">“Okay. He’s already doing life.” </p>


<p id="pYkUul">“I know.” </p>


<p id="1BkFS4">“You think you could do 18 months at Marysville?”</p>


<p id="VEY9vl">“Me? No.”</p>


<p id="4WB2Wi">“You’re how old?”</p>


<p id="WOKME3">“54.”</p>


<p id="lzWzQM">“Be kind of hard to do 18 months at 54 years old,” the trooper said. “Don’t you think?”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="bEbLAY">Investigators moved to interview Johnston, who, in the meantime, had been moved two hours northeast to Grafton Correctional Institution, another facility in the Ohio prison system. But he was reluctant to talk. Before he would explain what happened, he said, he wanted “some assurances” about his mother. </p>


<p id="yKyCau">The investigators said they couldn’t do it; he had involved her in felonies. When Johnston kept asking why he should cooperate, an investigator invoked his betrayal of Gallienne. “She couldn’t believe,” he said about Johnston’s mother. “She kept on saying, ‘He would never put me in harm’s way or in danger.’ I’m like, ‘We’re sitting right here, Karen.’ I said, ‘Obviously he did. He doesn’t care enough not to put you in harm’s way or in danger.’” He said Johnston’s brother — “the one you bad-mouth on the phone all the time,” the “piece of shit that you talk about and trash” — sat there stunned, but “at least he has enough sense not to get your mom involved in shit.”  </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="jz39u9"><q>“You know, you get a lot of fish, you’re full, you don’t eat all the other fish. Fill the prosecutor’s belly up with some fish.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="Xxb5vz">The state IT official in charge of monitoring the corrections department’s network was present at the interrogation, and he told Johnston that admitting to the crime would bode well for Gallienne. “It’s kinda like a fish fry,” he said. “You know, you get a lot of fish, you’re full, you don’t eat all the other fish. Fill the prosecutor’s belly up with some fish.”</p>


<p id="OSztv3">Johnston eventually relented and admitted to the deed, though his confession sounded incomplete. When investigators asked whether he had acted alone — and told him they had information from a confidential informant that he hadn’t — Johnston asked whether they had a confession or evidence from the alleged accomplice. When they said no, he told them, “I put them up there then,” referring to the computers in the ceiling.</p>


<p id="nTJQaI">The scheme Johnston sketched out showed resourcefulness. He had swiped some refurbished computers from RET3 that Spriggs had built for use inside the prison. When Canterbury left the P3 area unsupervised, Johnston brought them in and hooked them up in the ceiling for remote access. He said he “shoulder surfed” Canterbury’s password, casually leaning in while he was typing and memorizing the characters. (Meyer says he believes Canterbury may have handed over the password, but no proof of that materialized.)</p>


<p id="YT4uV8">With remote access, Johnston could access the prison staff network from a nearby office, where he was already allowed. No one on staff walking by would blink if they saw him working there. He said he stole the personal inmate information from an internal system called DOTS. That information was redacted, but Johnston simply viewed the code on the page.</p>

<p id="OjU6HI">How was Johnston able to move a computer from the RET3 area to P3?</p>


<p id="EJX1Vc">“In a cart,” he told investigators.</p>


<p id="HEkzyM">One of his gigs in prison involved carting around hygiene products to hand out to inmates in the recycling area. To get to P3, he had to get through a “crash gate” — a guarded area that included a metal detector. He told investigators that he stuffed the computers in a box with hygiene products — “it looked pretty legit,” he said — and was waved by. Transkiy, Johnston said, was totally unaware. When investigators asked about whether Spriggs was involved, he said they’d have to ask him. Spriggs denied any involvement. He was described as complicit in the state’s final report, but the inspector general’s office later told me he was only linked to building the computers, and Spriggs says he wasn’t aware of what they were used for.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="LQlClt"><q>“You are smart. I know you’re smart.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="js8ve6">The fraud was only one part of the scheme. Johnston admitted to using password recovery software to steal other administrative network logins (he denied using them), and was even printing his own forged passes for access around the facility. He claimed that he only used those to speed up the process for legitimate work. An inmate caught up in the investigation was found in possession of a thumb drive loaded with porn, which Johnston admitted to downloading. The setup was partly to blame for the pirated films and porn readily available in the prison. But Johnston was more ambitious: he said he was planning on filing some fraudulent tax returns to get some money, but it never got that far. He was “no expert,” he said.</p>


<p id="jniTpo">“Oh, but you’re so smart,” one of the investigators told him. “You are smart. I know you’re smart.”</p>


<p id="XBEYVC">“If I was smart I wouldn’t be here talking to you guys right now,” Johnston replied.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="ByVgv1">In August, I visited state inspector general Meyer at his office, in a high-rise across the street from the Columbus statehouse building. The afternoon I arrived, the small office was almost empty.</p>


<p id="kx2Yf9">Meyer has the square jaw and buzzed hair that, if you were to catch on a cable TV roundtable, would suggest law enforcement before he said anything. He drew me to a window and we looked down at the statehouse building, its round top illuminated in the sun. Meyer told me he sometimes hosts foreign visitors, and when he explains his job he jokes how it involves “literal oversight” of the government. “I’ve never stopped being surprised,” he told me, but he admitted this case — and the media reaction to it — was “very unique.” Meyer questioned whether inmates with life sentences should have access to reintegration training programs. If they weren’t ultimately contributing to the outside economy, what was the point?</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="DkSEb8"><q>Meyer questioned whether inmates with life sentences should have access to reintegration training programs</q></aside></div>


<p id="bJTHlW">The fallout from the crime began almost immediately. Before the investigators’ report on the computers was released, many staff members involved either retired or resigned from their posts. The warden moved out of corrections and to a program for the developmentally disabled. Canterbury now works at a county recycling program in the state. The results of the report could still lead to criminal charges, most likely for Johnston, and perhaps Gallienne. Meyer told me charges were being considered based on allegedly neglectful conduct by employees like the warden, but that they seem unlikely to stick. Two of the inmates I spoke with emailed me with an update in September. They’d heard someone else had been caught at Marion with illicit USB drives, possibly with hacking tools loaded on to them. (The prison did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>


<p id="F7ZrZj">Johnston, Spriggs, and Transkiy were “rode out,” as it’s called, to other facilities. For Transkiy, it was clear that being separated from Marion’s programs was a momentous loss. When he was first incarcerated, he says, he was involved in drugs and running with the wrong crowd. He declined to talk about the details, but reportedly <a href="https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/comrades-in-crime/Content?oid=1472982">killed the owner of a computer company</a> where he worked, part of a bizarre series of crimes in the local industry. After a decade in prison, his security level was lowered, and he was sent to Marion. </p>


<p id="tM7D5W">“When I arrived at the MCI, there were very few meaningful jobs available to someone with a lot of time,” he wrote me. For six months, he walked the track at the prison, before starting work on the fledgling recycling program. He took pride in some of the local media coverage it eventually garnered.</p>


<p id="kos7yJ">Transkiy says he didn’t know anything about the ceiling computers, though he’d had suspicions something was afoot; there were red flags like “long work hours by lazy people.” He says he passed a polygraph and no evidence linked him to the con. Regardless, he hasn’t fared well. The investigators found that he had used Canterbury’s computer, a violation of the rules, even though Transkiy says it was little more than sometimes using the mouse, and always supervised. </p>

<p id="oZEWOs">Before the programs at Marion started, there was nothing like them in the system, Transkiy says. “Therefore, there were simply no policies or protocols to accommodate all our needs and to address all issues and concerns,” he wrote me. “What I am trying to say, is that it is important to understand that MCI Green Initiative just grew too fast for security to properly address all the issues.” And maybe the whole thing was simply an unfortunate consequence of being on the vanguard of education. Michelle Tolbert, a researcher and author of the Department of Education report on electronics in prisons, suggested to me that there are bound to be speed bumps “when you’re on the forefront of anything.”</p>


<p id="LWrTDx">In a letter that Transkiy shared with me, Johnston apologized for the mess he’d made. “I know I ruined your life man,” he wrote to Transkiy. "I’m sorry. I’ll make it up to you someday.” </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="eeB7o5">Later in the letter, Johnston’s mind turned to the future. Transkiy, he suggested, should try to get to Grafton Correctional when his security level was lowered again. Like Marion, he wrote, it has some great programs. </p>

<p id="Bb8QmL"><em>This month marks 10 years since Apple launched the first iPhone, a device that would fundamentally transform how we interact with technology, culture, and each other. Ahead of that anniversary, </em>Motherboard<em> editor Brian Merchant embarked on an investigation to uncover the iPhone’s untold origin. </em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01LWRN0KI%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The One Device: The secret history of the iPhone</a>,<em> out on June 20th, traces that journey from Kenyan mines to Chinese factories all the way to One Infinite Loop. The following excerpt has been lightly condensed and edit</em><em>ed</em><em>.</em></p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CEqfhz">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UGTtF0">If you worked at Apple in the mid-2000s, you might have noticed a strange phenomenon afoot: people were disappearing. </p>


<p id="Ugn2WI">It happened slowly at first. One day there’d be an empty chair where a star engineer used to sit. A key member of the team, gone. Nobody could tell you exactly where they went. </p>


<p id="hRe19B">“I had been hearing rumblings about, well, it was unclear what was being built, but it was clear that a lot of the best engineers from the best teams had been slurped over to this mysterious team,” says Evan Doll, who was then a software engineer at Apple. </p>


<p id="QF15Ko">Here’s what was happening to those star engineers. First, a couple of managers had shown up in their office unannounced and closed the door behind them. Managers like Henri Lamiraux, a director of software engineering, and Richard Williamson, a director of software. </p>


<p id="B4AEDM">One such star engineer was Andre Boule. He’d been at the company only a few months. </p>


<p id="QKws4I">“Henri and I walked into his office,” Williamson recalls, “and we said, ‘Andre, you don’t really know us, but we’ve heard a lot about you, and we know you’re a brilliant engineer, and we want you to come work with us on a project we can’t tell you about. And we want you to do it now. Today.’ ” </p>


<p id="6mkKac">Boule was incredulous, then suspicious. “Andre said, ‘Can I have some time to think about it?’ ” Williamson says. “And we said, ‘No.’ ” They wouldn’t, and couldn’t, give him any more details. Still, by the end of the day, Boule had signed on. “We did that again and again across the company,” Williamson says. Some engineers who liked their jobs just fine said no, and they stayed in Cupertino. Those who said yes, like Boule, went to work on the iPhone. </p>


<p id="Ha8gf2">And their lives would never be the same — at least, not for the next two and a half years. Not only would they be working overtime to hammer together the most influential piece of consumer technology of their generation, but they’d be doing little else. Their personal lives would disappear, and they wouldn’t be able to talk about what they were working on. Steve Jobs “didn’t want anyone to leak it if they left the company,” says Tony Fadell, one of the top Apple executives who helped build the iPhone. “He didn’t want anyone to say anything. He just didn’t want — he was just naturally paranoid.” </p>

<p id="7kJIEz">Jobs told Scott Forstall, who would become the head of the iPhone software division, that even he couldn’t breathe a word about the phone to anyone, inside Apple or out, who wasn’t on the team. “He didn’t want, for secrecy reasons, for me to hire anyone outside of Apple to work on the user interface,” Forstall said. “But he told me I could move anyone in the company into this team.” So he dispatched managers like Henri and Richard to find the best candidates. And he made sure potential recruits knew the stakes upfront. “We’re starting a new project,” he told them. “It’s so secret, I can’t even tell you what that new project is. I cannot tell you who you will work for. What I can tell you is if you choose to accept this role, you’re going to work harder than you ever have in your entire life. You’re going to have to give up nights and weekends probably for a couple years as we make this product.” </p>


<p id="wn5JTB">And “amazingly,” as Forstall put it, some of the top talent at the company signed on. “Honestly, everyone there was brilliant,” Williamson tells me. That team — veteran designers, rising programmers, managers who’d worked with Jobs for years, engineers who’d never met him — would end up becoming one of the great, unheralded creative forces of the twenty-first century. </p>


<p id="Kqgx5B">One of Apple’s greatest strengths is that it makes its technology look and feel easy to use. There was nothing easy about making the iPhone, though its inventors say the process was often exhilarating. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="F6h1GK"><q>“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="zxyU93">Forstall’s prediction to the iPhone team would be borne out. </p>


<p id="z0dyvc">“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced,” Andy Grignon, a senior iPhone engineer, tells me. I heard that sentiment more than once throughout my dozens of interviews with the iPhone’s key architects and engineers. “Yeah, the iPhone ruined more than a few marriages,” says another. </p>


<p id="uWeb3F">“It was really intense, probably professionally one of the worst times of my life,” Grignon says. “Because you created a pressure cooker of a bunch of really smart people with an impossible deadline, an impossible mission, and then you hear that the future of the entire company is resting on it. So it was just like this soup of misery,” Grignon says. “There wasn’t really time to kick your feet back on the desk and say, ‘This is going to be really fucking awesome one day.’ It was like, ‘Holy fuck, we’re fucked.’ Every time you turned around there was some just imminent demise of the program just lurking around the corner.” </p>


<h1 id="YZQG7n"><strong>Making the iPhone </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="YaXYDp">The iPhone began as a Steve Jobs–approved project at Apple around the end of 2004. But its DNA began coiling long before that. </p>


<p id="llqibo">“I think a lot of people look at the form factor and they think it’s not just like any other computer, but it is — it’s just like any other computer,” Williamson says. “In fact, it’s <em>more</em> complex, in terms of software, than many other computers. The operating system on this is as sophisticated as the operating system on any modern computer. But it is an evolution of the operating system we’ve been developing over the last thirty years.”</p>

<p id="FZlsX8">Like many mass-adopted, highly profitable technologies, the iPhone has a number of competing origin stories. There were as many as five different phone or phone-related projects — from tiny research endeavors to full-blown corporate partnerships — bubbling up at Apple by the middle of the 2000s. But if there’s anything I’ve learned in my efforts to pull the iPhone apart, literally and figuratively, it’s that there are rarely concrete beginnings to any particular products or technologies — they evolve from varying previous ideas and concepts and inventions and are prodded and iterated into newness by restless minds and profit motives. Even when the company’s executives were under oath in a federal trial, they couldn’t name just one starting place. </p>


<p id="QXHMvC">“There were many things that led to the development of the iPhone at Apple,” Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in 2012. “First, Apple had been known for years for being the creator of the Mac, the computer, and it was great, but it had small market share,” he said. “And then we had a big hit called the iPod. It was the iPod hardware and the iTunes software. And this really changed everybody’s view of Apple, both inside and outside the company. And people started asking, Well, if you can have a big hit with the iPod, what else can you do? And people were suggesting every idea, make a camera, make a car, crazy stuff.” </p>


<p id="nQIWmr">And make a phone, of course. </p>


<h1 id="lzH8nA"><strong>Open the Pod Bay Doors </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="2eA8op">When Steve Jobs returned to take the helm of a flailing Apple in 1997, he garnered acclaim and earned a slim profit by slashing product lines and getting the Mac business back on track. But Apple didn’t reemerge as a major cultural and economic force until it released the iPod, which would mark its first profitable entry into consumer electronics and become a blueprint and a springboard for the iPhone in the process. </p>


<p id="3KNnl3">“There would be no iPhone without the iPod,” says Tony Fadell, who helped build both of them. Fadell, sometimes dubbed “the Podfather” by the media, was a driving force in creating Apple’s first bona fide hit device in years, and he’d oversee hardware development for the iPhone. As such, there are few better people to explain the bridge between the two hit devices. We met at Brasserie Thoumieux, a swank eatery in Paris’s gilded seventh arrondissement, where he was living at the time. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="G6xZdo"><q>He’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="67VoNm">Fadell is a looming figure in modern Silicon Valley lore, and he’s divisive in the annals of Apple. Brian Huppi and Joshua Strickon, key members of Apple’s input engineering team, who’d prototyped the earliest drafts of the iPhone, praise him for his audacious, get-it-done management style (“Don’t take longer than a year to ship a product” is one of his credos) and for being one of the few people strong enough of will to stand up to Steve Jobs. Others chafe at the credit he takes for his role in bringing the iPod and iPhone to market; he’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.” After he left Apple in 2008, he co-founded Nest, a company that crafted smart home gadgets, like learning thermostats, which was later acquired by Google for $3.2 billion. </p>


<p id="iHB9NT">Right on time, Fadell strode in; shaved head save for some stubble, icy blue eyes, snug sweater. He was once renowned for his cyberpunk style, his rebellious streak, and a fiery temper that was often compared to Jobs’s. Fadell is still undeniably intense, but here, speaking easy French to the waitstaff, he was smack in the overlap of a Venn diagram showing Mannered Parisian Elite and Brash Tech Titan. </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tmIJt9">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="450WOo">“The genesis of the iPhone, was — well, let’s get started with — was iPod dominance,” Fadell says. “It was fifty percent of Apple’s revenue.” But when iPods initially shipped in 2001, hardly anyone noticed them. “It took two years,” Fadell says. “It was only made for the Mac. It was less than one percent market share in the U.S. They like to say ‘low single digits.’ ” Consumers needed iTunes software to load and manage the songs and playlists, and that software ran only on Macs. </p>


<p id="jYRZEA">“Over my dead body are you gonna ship iTunes on a PC,” Steve Jobs told Fadell, he says, when Fadell pushed the idea of offering iTunes on Windows. Nonetheless, Fadell had a team secretly building out the software to make iTunes compatible with Windows. “It took two years of failing numbers before Steve finally woke up. Then we started to take off, then the music store was able to be a success.” That success put iPods in the hands of hundreds of millions of people— more than had ever owned Macs. Moreover, the iPod was hip in a fashionably mainstream way that lent a patina of cool to Apple as a whole. Fadell rose in the executive ranks and oversaw the new product division. </p>


<p id="ozNw5l">Launched in 2001, a hit by 2003, the iPod was deemed vulnerable as early as 2004. The mobile phone was seen as a threat because it could play MP3s. “So if you could only carry one device, which one would you have to choose?” Fadell says. “And that’s why the Motorola Rokr happened.” </p>


<h1 id="4nwGV7"><strong>Rokring Out </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="prGx7F">In 2004, Motorola was manufacturing one of the most popular phones on the market, the ultrathin Razr flip phone. Its new CEO, Ed Zander, was friendly with Jobs, who liked the Razr’s design, and the two set about exploring how Apple and Motorola might collaborate. (In 2003, Apple execs had considered buying Motorola outright but decided it’d be too expensive.) Thus the “iTunes phone” was born. Apple and Motorola partnered with the wireless carrier Cingular, and the Rokr was announced that summer. </p>


<p id="UOpVAG">Publicly, Jobs had been resistant to the idea of Apple making a phone. “The problem with a phone,” Steve Jobs said in 2005, “is that we’re not very good going through orifices to get to the end users.” By <em>orifices</em>, he meant carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T, which had final say over which phones could access their networks. “Carriers now have gained the upper hand in terms of the power of the relationship with the handset manufacturers,” he continued. “So the handset manufacturers are really getting these big thick books from the carriers telling them here’s what your phone’s going to be. We’re not good at that.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="EBCgzx"><q>Jobs “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd.’” </q></aside></div>


<p id="i0Dfgp">Privately, Jobs had other reservations. One former Apple executive who had daily meetings with Jobs told me that the carrier issue wasn’t his biggest hang-up. He was concerned with a lack of focus in the company, and he “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd,’ as we used to call them.” </p>


<p id="1T3MQw">Partnering with Motorola was an easy way to try to neutralize a threat to the iPod. Motorola would make the handset; Apple would do the iTunes software. “It was, How can we make it a very small experience, so they still had to buy an iPod? Give them a taste of iTunes and basically turn it into an iPod Shuffle so that they’ll want to upgrade to an iPod. That was the initial strategy,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Let’s not cannibalize the iPod because it’s going so well.’ ” </p>


<div id="BTFzkJ"><div></div></div>


<p id="BuZLVX">As soon as the collaboration was made public, Apple’s voracious rumor mill started churning. With an iTunes phone on the horizon, blogs began feeding the anticipation for a transformative mobile device that had been growing for some time already. </p>


<p id="V18ldG">Inside Apple, however, expectations for the Rokr could not have been lower. “We all knew how bad it was,” Fadell says. “They’re slow, they can’t get things to change, they’re going to limit the songs.” Fadell laughs aloud when discussing the Rokr today. “All of these things were coming together to make sure it was really a shitty experience.” </p>


<p id="gNi2Wa">But there may have been another reason that Apple’s executives were tolerating the Rokr’s unfurling shittiness. “Steve was gathering information during those meetings” with Motorola and Cingular, Richard Williamson says. He was trying to figure out how he might pursue a deal that would let Apple retain control over the design of its phone. He considered having Apple buy its own bandwidth and become its own mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO. Apple approached Verizon, but the two companies were unable to ink a deal; telecoms still wanted too much control over how a handset was designed. An executive at Cingular, meanwhile, began to cobble together an alternative deal Jobs might actually embrace: <em>Give Cingular exclusivity, and we’ll give you complete freedom over the device</em>. </p>


<h1 id="RmmhtJ"><strong>Fix What You Hate </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="mXjbik">From Steve Jobs to Jony Ive to Tony Fadell to Apple’s engineers, designers, and managers, there’s one part of the iPhone mythology that everyone tends to agree on: Before the iPhone, everyone at Apple thought cell phones “sucked.” They were “terrible.” Just “pieces of junk.” We’ve already seen how Jobs felt about phones that dropped calls. </p>


<p id="X2Hoaf">“Apple is best when it’s fixing the things that people hate,” Greg Christie, who was head of Apple’s Human Interface Group at the time, tells me. Before the iPod, nobody could figure out how to use a digital music player; as Napster boomed, people took to carting around skip-happy portable CD players loaded with burned albums. And before the Apple II, computers were mostly considered too complex and unwieldy for the layperson. </p>


<p id="yiHN0i">“For at least a year before starting on what would become the iPhone project, even internally at Apple, we were grumbling about how all of these phones out there were all terrible,” says Nitin Ganatra, who managed Apple’s email team before working on the iPhone. It was water-cooler talk. But it reflected a growing sense inside the company that since Apple had successfully fixed — transformed, then dominated — one major product category, it could do the same with another. </p>


<p id="Re3CSK">“At the time,” Ganatra says, “it was like, ‘Oh my God, we need to go in and clean up this market too — why isn’t Apple making a phone?’ ” </p>


<h1 id="pQygSc">
<strong>Calling All Pods</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="f4uxKW">Andy Grignon was restless. The versatile engineer had been at Apple for a few years, working in different departments on various projects. He’s a gleefully imposing figure— shaved-head bald, cheerful, and built like a friendly bear. He had a hand in everything from creating the software that powered the iPod to working on the software for a videoconferencing program and iChat. He’d become friends with rising star Tony Fadell when they’d built the iSight camera together. </p>


<p id="C3mU2Y">After wrapping up another major project — writing the Mac feature Dashboard, which Grignon affectionately calls “his baby” (it’s the widget-filled screen with the calculator and the calendar and so on) — he was looking for something fresh to do. “Fadell reached out and said, ‘Do you want to come join iPod? We’ve got some really cool shit. I’ve got this other project I really want to do but we need some time before we can convince Steve to do it, and I think you’d be great for it.’” </p>


<p id="17F8cL">Grignon is boisterous and hardworking. He’s also got a mouth like a Silicon Valley sailor. “So I left,” Grignon says, “to work on this mystery thing. So we just kind of spun our wheels on some wireless speakers and shit like that, but then the project started to materialize. Of course what Fadell was talking about was the phone.” Fadell knew Jobs was beginning to come around to the idea, and he wanted to be prepared. “We had this idea: Wouldn’t it be great to put WiFi in an iPod?” Grignon says. Throughout 2004, Fadell, Grignon, and the rest of the team worked on a number of early efforts to fuse iPod and internet communicator. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="mJl7Sm"><q>It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’” </q></aside></div>


<p id="PScVYu">“That was one of the very first prototypes I showed Steve. We gutted an iPod, we had hardware add in a WiFi part, so it was a big plastic piece of junk, and we modified the software.” There were click-wheel iPods that could clumsily surf the web as early as 2004. “You would click the wheel, you would scroll the web page, and if there was a link on the page, it would highlight it, and you could click on it and you could jump in,” Grignon says. “That was the very first time where we started experimenting with radios in the form factor.” </p>


<p id="73VLAt">It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’ He called it right away… ‘I don’t want this. I know it works, I got it, great, thanks, but this is a shitty experience,’ ” Grignon says. </p>


<p id="qIof7q">Meanwhile, Grignon says, “The exec team was trying to convince Steve that building a phone was a great idea for Apple. He didn’t really see the path to success.” </p>


<p id="dUqHna">One of those trying to do the convincing was Mike Bell. A veteran of Apple, where he’d worked for fifteen years, and of Motorola’s wireless division, Bell was positive that computers, music players, and cell phones were heading toward an inevitable convergence point. For months, he lobbied Jobs to do a phone, as did Steve Sakoman, a vice president who had worked on the ill-fated Newton. </p>


<p id="R1avKg">“We were spending all this time putting iPod features in Motorola phones,” Bell says. “That just seemed ass-backwards to me. If we just took the iPod user experience and some of the other stuff we were working on, we could own the market.” It was getting harder to argue with that logic. The latest batches of MP3 phones were looking increasingly like iPod competitors, and new alternatives for dealing with the carriers were emerging. Meanwhile, Bell had seen Jony Ive’s latest iPod designs.</p>


<p id="drK79D">On November 7, 2004, Bell sent Jobs a late-night email. “Steve, I know you don’t want to do a phone,” he wrote, “but here’s why we should do it: Jony Ive has some really cool designs for future iPods that no one has seen. We ought to take one of those, put some Apple software around it, and make a phone out if ourselves instead of putting our stuff on other people’s phones.” </p>


<p id="3NTk7J">Jobs called him right away. They argued for hours, pushing back and forth. Bell detailed his convergence theory — no doubt mentioning the fact that the mobile phone market was exploding worldwide — and Jobs picked it apart. Finally, he relented. </p>


<p id="POLpVa">“Okay, I think we should go do it,” he said. </p>


<p id="5rqNQ5">“So Steve and I and Jony and Sakoman had lunch three or four days later and kicked off the iPhone project.” </p>


<h1 id="jQil50"><strong>Reviving the Apple Tablet </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="pH51ih">At 2 Infinite Loop, an older touchscreen-tablet research project was still chugging along. Bas Ording, Imran Chaudhri, and company were still exploring the contours of a basic touch-focused user interface.</p>


<p id="uDdZqH">One day, Bas Ording got a call from Steve. He said, “We’re gonna do a phone.” </p>


<p id="o4Dewr">Years ago, a handful of input engineers and key designers had prototyped multitouch-focused interaction demos, followed by the Q79 tablet project — an experimental early stab at an iPad-like device. But a tangle of obstacles, not least of which was that it was too expensive, shut it down. (“You’ve got to give me something I can sell,” he told Imran.) But with a smaller screen and scaled-down system, Q79 might work as a phone. </p>


<p id="je6L7A">“It’s gonna have a small screen, it’s gonna be just a touchscreen, there’s not gonna be any buttons, and everything has to work on that,” Jobs told Ording. He asked the UI wiz to make a demo of scrolling through a virtual address book with multitouch. “I was super-excited,” Ording says. “I thought, <em>Yeah, it seems kind of impossible, but it would be fun to just try it</em>.” He sat down, “moused off” a phone-size section of his Mac’s screen, and used it to model the iPhone surface. He and a scant few other designers had spent years experimenting with touch-based user interfaces — and those years in the touchscreen wilderness were paying off. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="9d3K55"><q>“When I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ”</q></aside></div>


<p id="x08Vdh">“We already had some other demos, a web page, for example — it was just a picture you could scroll with momentum,” Ording says. “That’s sort of how it started.” The famous effect where your screen bounces when you hit the top or bottom of a page was born because Ording couldn’t tell when he’d hit the top of a page. “I thought my program wasn’t running because I tried to scroll and nothing would happen,” he says, and then he’d realize he was scrolling in the wrong direction. “So that’s when I started to think, <em>How can I make it so you can see or feel that you’re at the end?</em> Right? Instead of feeling dead, like it’s not responding.” </p>


<p id="pFyn3W">These small details, which we now take for granted, were the product of exhaustive tinkering, of proof-of-concept experimenting. Like inertial scrolling, the wonky-sounding but now-universal effect that makes scrolling down your contact list feel satisfyingly tactile; the names fly by in a burst after you swipe down, then slow to a tick-tock as if bound by real-world physics</p>


<p id="t0pvdB">“I had to try all kinds of things and figure out some math,” Ording says. “Not all of it was complicated, but you have to get to the right combinations, and that’s the tricky thing. ” Eventually, Ording got it to feel natural.</p>


<p id="JJAuiA">“He called me back a few weeks later, and he had inertial scrolling working,” Jobs said. “And when I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ” </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Y8HXgl">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="FaPRI7">Scott Forstall walked into Greg Christie’s office near the end of 2004 and gave him the news too: Jobs wanted to do a phone. He’d been waiting about a decade to hear those words. </p>


<p id="TxLnho">Christie is intense and brusque; his stocky build and sharp eyes feel loaded with kinetic energy. He joined Apple in the 1990s, when the company was in a downward spiral, just to work on the Newton— then one of the most promising mobile devices on the market. Then, he’d even tried to push Apple to do a Newton phone. “I’m sure I proposed it a dozen times,” Christie says. “The internet was popping too— this is going to be a big deal: mobile, internet, phone.” </p>


<p id="qwwfYV">Now, his Human Interface team — his knobs-and-dials crew — was about to embark on its most radical challenge yet. Its members gathered on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop, right above the old user-testing lab, and set to work expanding the features, functionality, and look of the old ENRI tablet project. The handful of designers and engineers set up shop in a drab office replete with stained carpet, old furniture, a leaky bathroom next door, and little on the walls but a whiteboard and, for some reason, a poster of a chicken. </p>


<p id="dk3fsB">Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes. The CEO was already imbuing the nascent iPhone project with top-to-bottom secrecy. “You know, the cleaning crews weren’t allowed in here because there were these sliding whiteboards along the wall,” Christie says. The team would sketch ideas on them, and the good ones stayed put. “We wouldn’t erase them. They became part of the design conversation.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="RS5bNz"><q>Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes</q></aside></div>


<p id="15zJIt">That conversation was about how to blend a touch-based UI with smartphone features. </p>


<p id="6niJw1">Fortunately, they’d had a head start. There were the ENRI crew’s multitouch demos, of course. But Imran Chaudhri had also led the design for Dashboard, which was full of widgets — weather, stocks, calculator, notes, calendar — that would be ideal for the phone. “The early idea for the phone was all about having these widgets in your pocket,” Chaudhri says. So they ported them over. </p>


<p id="DNO1C6">The original design for many of those icons was actually created in a single night, back during the development of Dashboard. “It was one of those fucking crazy Steve deadlines,” Imran says, “where he wanted to see a demo of everything.” So he and Freddy Anzures, a recent hire to the HI team, spent a long night coming up with the rectilinear design concepts for the widgets — which would, years later, become the designs for the iPhone icons. “It’s funny, the look of smartphone icons for a decade to come was hashed out in a few hours.” </p>


<p id="c6IbtN">And they had to establish the fundamentals; for instance, What should it look like when you fire up your phone? A grid of apps seems like the obvious way to organize a smartphone’s functions today — now that it’s like water, as Chaudhri says — but it wasn’t a foregone conclusion. “We tried some other stuff,” Ording says. “Like, maybe it’s a list of icons with the names after them.” But what came to be called Springboard emerged early on as the standard. “They were little Chiclets, basically,” Ording says. “Now, that’s Imran too, that was a great idea, and it looked really nice.” </p>


<p id="34Magt">Chaudhri had the Industrial Design team make a few wooden iPhone-like mock-ups so they could figure out the optimal size of the icons for a finger’s touch. </p>


<p id="jLGMAE">The multitouch demos were promising, and the style was coming together. But what the team lacked was cohesion — a united idea of what a touch-based phone would be. </p>


<p id="f3Scow">“It was really just sketches,” Christie says. “Little fragments of ideas, like tapas. A little bit of this, a little of that. Could be part of Address Book, a slice of Safari.” Tapas wouldn’t sate Jobs, obviously; he wanted a full course. So he grew increasingly frustrated with the presentations. </p>


<p id="yUd9zE">“In January, in the New Year, he blows a gasket and tells us we’re not getting it,” Christie says. The fragments might have been impressive, but there was no narrative drawing the disparate parts together; it was a jumble of half-apps and ideas. There was no story. </p>


<p id="H4IgZm">“It was as if you delivered a story to your editor and it was a couple of sentences from the introductory paragraph, a few from the body, and then something from the middle of the conclusion — but not the concluding statement.” </p>


<p id="gVp0AG">It simply wasn’t enough. “Steve gave us an ultimatum,” Christie recalls. “He said, You have two weeks. It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.” </p>


<p id="Xhmqyk">So Christie gathered the HI team to make the case that they should all march with him. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="r2OiXS"><q>“It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="BDU7ya">“Doing a phone is what I always wanted to do,” he said. “I think the rest of you want to do this also. But we’ve got two weeks for one last chance to do this. And I really want to do it.” </p>


<p id="T7z1Yc">He wasn’t kidding. For a decade, Christie had believed mobile computing was destined to converge with cell phones. This was his opportunity not only to prove he was right, but to drive the spark. </p>


<p id="QCFMqb">The small team was on board: Bas, Imran, Christie, three other designers — Stephen LeMay, Marcel van Os, and Freddy Anzures — and a project manager, Patrick Coffman. They worked around the clock to tie those fragments into a full-fledged narrative. </p>


<p id="DKNV4S">“We basically went to the mattresses,” Christie says. Each designer was given a fragment to realize — an app to flesh out — and the team spent two sleepless weeks perfecting the shape and feel of an inchoate iPhone. And at the end of the death march, something resembling the one device emerged from the exhausted fog of the HI floor. </p>


<p id="Ls2B0F">“I have no doubt that if I could resurrect that demo and show it to you now, you would have no problem recognizing it as an iPhone,” Christie says. There was a home button — still software-based at this point — scrolling, and the multitouch media manipulations. </p>


<p id="lZM46F">“We showed Steve the outline of the whole story. Showed him the home screen, showed him how a call comes in, how to go to your Address Book, and ‘this is what Safari looks like,’ and it was a little click through. It wasn’t just some clever quotes, it told a story.” </p>


<p id="4GtjXL">And Steve Jobs did love a good story. </p>

<p id="O5ZNOH">“It was a smashing success,” Christie says. “He wanted to go through it a second time. Anyone who saw it thought it was great. It was great.” </p>


<p id="EPTuhr">It meant that the project was immediately deemed top secret. After the February demo, badge readers were installed on either end of the Human Interface group’s hallway, on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop. “It was lockdown,” Christie says. “That’s what you say when there’s a prison riot, right? That was the phrase. Yeah, we’re on lockdown.” </p>


<p id="yKhqPK">It also meant they had a lot more work to do. If the touch interface research meetings were prologue, the tablet prototyping the beginning, then this was the second act of the iPhone, and there was much left to be written. But now that Jobs was invested in the narrative, he wanted to show it off, in high style, to the rest of the company. “We had this ‘big demo’ — that’s what we called it,” Ording says. Steve wanted to show the iPhone prototype at the Top 100 meeting inside Apple. “They have this meeting every once in a while with all the important people, saying what the direction of the company is,” Ording tells me. Jobs would invite the people he considered his top one hundred employees to a secret retreat, where they’d present and discuss upcoming products and strategies. For rising Applers, it was a make-or-break career opportunity. For Jobs, the presentations had to be as carefully calibrated as public-facing product launches. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="GVuHT7"><q>“What are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email?” </q></aside></div>


<p id="6JYH9N">“From then until May, it was another brutal haul, to, well…  come up with connecting paragraphs,” Christie says. “Okay, what are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email? Every step on this journey was just making it more and more concrete and more real. Playing songs out of your iTunes. Media playback. iPhone software started as a design project in my hallway with my team.” Christie hacked the latest model of the iPod so the designers could get a feel for what the applications might look like on a device. The demo began to take shape. “You could tap on the mail app and see how that kind of works, and the web browser,” Ording says. “It wasn’t fully working, but enough that you could get the idea.” </p>


<p id="FWIDZN">Christie uses one word to describe how the team toiled around the clock, you might have noticed, above all others. It was “brutal, grueling work. I put people in hotel rooms because I didn’t want them driving home. People crashed at my house,” he says, but “it was exhilarating at the same time.” </p>


<p id="nf6lFi">Steve Jobs had been blown away by the results. And soon, so was everyone else. The presentation at Top 100 was another smash success. </p>


<h1 id="1W1dBR">
<strong>The Bod of an iPod </strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="W1YZR0">When Fadell heard that a phone project was taking shape, he grabbed his own skunkworks prototype design of the iPod phone before he headed into an executive meeting. </p>


<p id="yLa1q9">“There was a meeting where they were talking about the formation of the phone project on the team,” Grignon says. “Tony had [it] in his back pocket, a team already working on the hardware and the schematics, all the design for it. And once they got the approval for it from Steve, Tony was like, ‘Oh, hold on, as a matter of fact’— <em>whoochaa!</em> Like he whipped it out, ‘Here’s this prototype that we’ve been thinking about,’ and it was basically a fully baked design.” </p>


<p id="UUsrHv">On paper, the logic looks impeccable: The iPod was Apple’s most successful product, phones were going to eat the iPod’s lunch, so why not an iPod phone? “Take the best of the iPod and put a phone in it,” Fadell says. “So you could do mobile communications and have your music with you, and we didn’t lose all the brand awareness we’d built into the iPod, the half a billion dollars we were spending getting that known around the world.” It was that simple. </p>


<p id="l69kjh">Remember that while it was becoming clear inside Apple that they were going to pursue a phone, it wasn’t clear at all what that phone should look or feel like. Or how it would work, on just about every level. </p>


<p id="BRNKJM">“Early 2005, around that time frame, Tony started saying there’s talk about them doing a phone,” says David Tupman, who was in charge of iPod hardware at the time. “And I said, ‘I really want to do a phone. I’d like to lead that.’ He said, ‘No.’ ” Tupman laughs. “ ‘You can’t do that.’ But they did a bunch of interviews, and I guess they couldn’t find anybody, so I was like, ‘Hello, I’m still here!’ Tony was like, ‘Okay, you’re it.’ ” </p>


<p id="wBI4Ii">The iPod team wasn’t privy to what had been unfolding in the HI group. </p>


<p id="ZhvfxA">“We were gonna build what everyone thought we should build at the time: Let’s bolt a phone onto an iPod,” says Andy Grignon. And that’s exactly what they started to do. </p>


<h1 id="ko2XlY"><strong>What’s It Going to Be? </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="uoJTfB">Richard Williamson found himself in Steve Jobs’s office. He’d gone in to discuss precisely the kind of thing that nobody wanted to discuss with Steve Jobs — leaving Apple. </p>


<p id="vUI5qX">For years, he had been in charge of the team that developed the framework that powered Safari, called WebKit. Here’s a fun fact about WebKit: Unlike most products developed and deployed by Apple, it’s open-source. Here’s another: Until 2013, Google’s own Chrome browser was powered by WebKit too. It’s big-deal software, in other words. And Williamson was, as <em>Forbes</em> put it, “what’s commonly referred to as a ‘@#$ rock star’ in Silicon Valley.” But he was getting burned out on upgrading the same platform. </p>


<p id="9WcXNR">“We had gone through three or four versions of WebKit, and I was thinking of moving to Google,” he says. “That’s when Steve invited me.” </p>


<p id="xg2VWj">And Steve wasn’t happy.</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gZ0DXo">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="cTXrhR">When you think “successful computer engineer,” the stock photo that springs to mind is pretty much what Williamson looks like — bespectacled, unrepentantly geekish, brainy, wearing a button-down shirt. We met for an interview at a Palo Alto sushi joint that eschewed waiters in favor of automated service via table-mounted iPads. Seemed fitting. </p>


<p id="RLWlrc">Williamson is soft-spoken, with a light British accent. He seems affable but shy — there’s a slightly anxious undercurrent to his speech — and unmistakably sharp. He’s apt to rattle off ideas pulled from a deep knowledge of code, industry acumen, and the philosophy of technology, sometimes in the same breath. </p>

<p id="slKGNr">In the mid-‘80s, a friend convinced Williamson to start a company writing software for the Commodore Amiga, an early PC. “We wrote a program called Marauder, which was a program to make archival backups of copy-protected disks.” He laughs. “That’s kind of the diplomatic way of describing the program.” Basically, they created a tool that allowed users to pirate software. “So we had a little bit of a recurring revenue stream,” he says slyly. </p>


<p id="96d6Ak">In 1985, Steve Jobs’s post-Apple company, NeXT, was still a small operation, and hungry for good engineers. There, Williamson met with two NeXT officers and one Steve Jobs. He showed them the work that he’d done on the Amiga, and they hired him on the spot. The young programmer would go on to spend the next quarter of a century in Jobs’s— and the NeXT team’s— orbit, working on the software that would become integral to the iPhone. </p>


<p id="uWdsTA">“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="J6dts7"><q>“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="2f5fNQ">So Williamson asked to see it. “At this point, there was nobody on the project from a software perspective, it was all just kind of an idea in Steve’s mind.” It didn’t seem like a convincing reason for Williamson to pass up an enticing new offer. “Google was interested in giving me some very interesting work too, so it was a very pivotal moment,” he says. </p>


<p id="mzeMIi">“So I said, ‘Well, the screen isn’t there, the display tech is kind of not really there.’ But Steve convinced me it was. That the path would be there.” Williamson pauses for a second. “It’s all true about Steve,” Williamson says with a quick smile. “I was with him since NeXT, and I’ve fallen under his glare many times.” </p>


<p id="zOC7VU">What would it be, then? Of course, Williamson would stay. “So I became an advocate at that point of building a device to browse the web.” </p>


<h1 id="cgFs0b">
<strong>Which Phone</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="DTiXB8">“Steve wanted to do a phone, and he wanted to do it as fast as he could,” Williamson says. But which phone? </p>


<p id="E8dlpC">There were two options: (a) take the beloved, widely recognizable iPod and hack it to double as a phone (that was the easier path technologically, and Jobs wasn’t envisioning the iPhone as a mobile computing device but as a souped-up phone), or (b) transmogrify a Mac into a tiny touch-tablet that made calls (which was an exciting idea but frayed with futuristic abstraction).</p>


<p id="VukiZw">“After the big demo,” Ording says, “the engineers started to look into, What would it take to actually make this real? On the hardware side but also the software side,” Ording says. To say the engineers who first examined it were skeptical about its near-term viability would be an understatement. “They went, ‘Oh my God, this is— we don’t know, this is going to be a lot of work. We don’t even know how much work.’ ” </p>


<p id="2UIBel">There was so much that needed to be done to translate the multitouch Mac mass into a product, and one with so many new, unproven technologies, that it was difficult even to put forward a roadmap, to conceive of all of its pieces coming together.<strong> </strong></p>


<h1 id="JXZVuw">
<strong>For Those About to Rokr</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="BWIe04">Development had continued on the Rokr throughout 2005. “We all thought the Rokr was a joke,” Williamson says. The famously hands-on CEO didn’t see the finished Rokr until early September 2005, right before he was supposed to announce it to the world. And he was aghast. “He was like, ‘What else can we do, how can we fix it?’ He knew it was subpar but he didn’t know how bad it was going to be. When it finally got there, he didn’t even want to show it onstage because he was so embarrassed by it,” Fadell says. </p>


<div id="2ic7Pr"><div></div></div>


<p id="OIIJWo">During the demonstration, Jobs held the phone like an unwashed sock. At one point the Rokr failed to switch from making calls to playing music, leaving him visibly agitated. So, at about the same moment that Jobs was announcing “the world’s first mobile phone with iTunes” to the media, he was resolving to make it obsolete. He helped by lavishing praise on the new iPod Nano, clearly elevating it as the star of the show and reportedly leaving Motorola execs fuming. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="4gLzC2"><q>Rokr’s sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise</q></aside></div>


<p id="69z2jN">“When he got offstage he was just like, ‘Ugh,’ really upset,” Fadell says. The Rokr was such a disaster that it landed on the cover of <em>Wired</em> with the headline “You Call This the Phone of the Future?” and it was soon being returned at a rate six times higher than the industry average. Its sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise — and his anger helped motivate him to squeeze the trigger harder on an Apple-built phone. “It wasn’t when it failed. It was right after it launched,” Fadell says. “This is not gonna fly. I’m sick and tired of dealing with bozo handset guys,” Jobs told Fadell after the demo. </p>


<p id="oWo4eO">“That was the ultimate thing,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Fuck this, we’re going to make our own phone.’ ” </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kA5CbC">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="K7EN5Y">“Steve called a big meeting in the boardroom,” Ording says. “Everyone was there, Phil Schiller and Jony Ive and whoever.” He said, “Listen. We’re going to change plans…  We’re going to do this iPod-based thing, make that into a phone because that’s a much more doable project. More predictable.” That was Fadell’s project. The touchscreen effort wasn’t abandoned, but while the engineers worked on whipping it into shape, Jobs directed Ording, Chaudhri, and members of the UI team to design an interface for an iPod phone, a way to dial numbers, select contacts, and browse the web using that device’s tried-and-true click wheel. </p>


<p id="RsuEfJ">There were now two competing projects vying to become the iPhone — a “bake-off,” as some engineers put it. The two phone projects were split into tracks, code-named P1 and P2, respectively. Both were top secret. P1 was the iPod phone. P2 was the still-experimental hybrid of multitouch technology and Mac software. </p>


<p id="oMeap7">If there’s a ground zero for the political strife that would later come to engulf the project, it’s likely here, in the decision to split the two teams — Fadell’s iPod division, which was still charged with updating that product line in addition to prototyping the iPod phone, and Scott Forstall’s Mac OS software vets — and drive them to compete. (The Human Interface designers, meanwhile, worked on both P1 and P2.) </p>


<p id="OSmvdM">Eventually, the executives overseeing the most important elements of the iPhone — software, hardware, and industrial design — would barely be able to tolerate sitting in the same room together. One would quit, others would be fired, and one would emerge solidly — and perhaps solely — as the new face of Apple’s genius in the post-Jobs era. Meanwhile, the designers, engineers, and coders would work tirelessly, below the political fray, to turn the Ps into working devices in any way possible. </p>


<h1 id="eHa8EM"><strong>The Purple People Leader</strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="oBtBaN">Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple. </p>


<p id="36Tdqy">“One of the buildings we have up in Cupertino, we locked it down,” said Scott Forstall, who had managed Mac OS X software and who would come to run the entire iPhone software program. “We started with one floor”— where Greg Christie’s Human Interface team worked — “We locked the entire floor down. We put doors with badge readers, there were cameras, I think, to get to some of our labs, you had to badge in four times to get there.” He called it the Purple Dorm because, “much like a dorm, people were there all the time.” </p>


<p id="2jULzH">They “put up a sign that said ‘Fight Club’ because the first rule of Fight Club in the movie is that you don’t talk about Fight Club, and the first rule about the Purple Project is you do not talk about that outside of those doors,” Forstall said. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="3Y18zh"><q>Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple. </q></aside></div>


<p id="D7Sj7r">Why Purple? Few seem to recall. One theory is it was named after a purple aardvark toy that Scott Herz — one of the first engineers to come to work on the iPhone — had as a mascot for Radar, the system that Apple engineers used to keep track of software bugs and glitches throughout the company. “All the bugs are tracked inside of Radar at Apple, and a lot of people have access to Radar,” says Richard Williamson. “So if you’re a curious engineer, you can go spelunking around the bug-tracking system and find out what people are working on. And if you’re working on a secret project, you have to think about how to cover your tracks there.” </p>


<p id="1T8QiT">Scott Forstall, born in 1969, had been downloading Apple into his brain his entire life. By junior high, his precocious math and science skills landed him in an advanced-placement course with access to an Apple IIe computer. He learned to code, and to code well. Forstall didn’t fit the classic computer-geek mold, though. He was a debate team champ and a performer in high-school musicals; he played the lead in <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, that hammy demon barber. Forstall graduated from Stanford in 1992 with a master’s in computer science and landed a job at NeXT. </p>

<p id="5R8Jpi">After releasing an overpriced computer aimed at the higher education market, NeXT flailed as a hardware company, but it survived by licensing its powerful NeXTSTEP operating system. In 1996, Apple bought NeXT and brought Jobs back into the fold, and the decision was made to use NeXTSTEP to overhaul the Mac’s aging operating system. It became the foundation on which Macs— and iPhones— still run today. At Jobs-led Apple, Forstall rose through the ranks. He mimicked his idol’s management style and distinctive taste. <em>BusinessWeek</em> called him “the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.” </p>


<p id="rna8mw">One of his former colleagues praised him as a smart, savvy leader but said he went overboard on the Jobs-worship: “He was generally great, but sometimes it was like, just be yourself.” Forstall emerged as the leader of the effort to adapt Mac software to a touchscreen phone. Though some found his ego and naked ambition distasteful — he was “very much in need of adulation,” according to one peer, and called “a starfucker” by another — few dispute the caliber of his intellect and work ethic. “I don’t know what other people have said about Scott,” Henri Lamiraux says, “but he was a pleasure to work with.” </p>


<p id="i9jw5e">Forstall led many of the top engineers he’d worked with since his NeXT days — Henri Lamiraux and Richard Williamson among them — into the P2 project. Williamson jokingly called the crew “the NeXT mafia.” True to the name, they would at times behave in a manner befitting a close-knit, secretive (and highly efficient) organization. </p>


<h1 id="NLgfqF"><strong>P1 Thing After Another </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="62X3nV">Tony Fadell was Forstall’s chief competition. </p>


<p id="UrxvsE">“From a politics perspective, Tony wanted to own the entire experience,” Grignon says. “The software, the hardware… once people started to see the importance of this project to Apple, everyone wanted to get their fingers in it. And that’s when the epic fight between Fadell and Forstall began.” </p>


<p id="RP0Vuz">Having worked with Forstall on Dashboard, Grignon was in a unique position to interface with both groups. “From our perspective, Forstall and his crew, we always viewed them as the underdogs. Like they were trying to wedge their way in,” Grignon says. “We had complete confidence that our stack was going to happen because this is Tony’s project, and Tony’s responsible for millions upon millions of iPod sales.” </p>


<p id="3OSoFX">So, the pod team worked to produce a new pod-phone cut from the mold of Apple’s ubiquitous music player. Their idea was to produce an iPod that would have two distinct modes: the music player and a phone. “We prototyped a new way,” Grignon says of the early device. “It was this interesting material…  it still had this touch sensitive click wheel, right, and the Play/Pause/Next/Previous buttons in blue backlighting. And when you put it into phone mode through the UI, all that light kind of faded out and faded back in as orange. Like, zero to nine in the click wheel in an old rotary phone, you know, ABCDEGF around the edges.” When the device was in musicplaying mode, blue backlighting would show iPod controls around the touch wheel. The screen would still be filled with iPod-style text and lists, and if you toggled it to phone mode, it’d glow orange and display numbers like the dial of a rotary phone. </p>


<p id="hiFjFa">“We put a radio inside, effectively an iPod Mini with a speaker and headphones, still using the touch-wheel interface,” Tupman says. </p>

</div>


<p id="NoG0fw">“And when you texted, it dialed — and it worked!” Grignon says. “So we built a couple hundred of them.” </p>


<p id="0Ta209">The problem was that they were difficult to use as phones. “After we made the first iteration of the software, it was clear that this was going nowhere,” Fadell says. “Because of the wheel interface. It was never gonna work because you don’t want a rotary dial on the phone.” </p>


<p id="0hGNn6">The design team tried mightily to hack together a solution. </p>


<p id="kd5o0R">“I came up with some ideas for the predictive typing,” Bas Ording says. There would be an alphabet laid out at the bottom of the screen, and users would use the wheel to select letters. “And then you can just, like, <em>click-click-click-click</em> — ‘Hello, how are you.’ So I just built an actual thing that can learn as you type — it would build up a database of words that follow each other.” But the process was still too tedious. </p>


<p id="1xTNz4">“It was just obvious that we were overloading the click wheel with too much,” Grignon says. “And texting and phone numbers — it was a fucking mess.” </p>


<p id="G8rJmc">“We tried everything,” Fadell says. “And nothing came out to make it work. Steve kept pushing and pushing, and we were like, ‘Steve.’ He’s pushing the rock up a hill. Let’s put it this way: I think he knew, I could tell in his eyes that he knew; he just wanted it to work,” he says. “He just kept beating this dead horse.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="YIzCc9"><q>“I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ” </q></aside></div>


<p id="etXNOv">“C’mon, there’s gotta be a way,” Jobs would tell Fadell. “He didn’t just want to give up. So he pushed until there was nothing there,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="cTCmyH">They even filed for a patent for the ill-fated device, and in the bowels of Cupertino, there were offices and labs littered with dozens of working iPod phones. “We actually made phone calls,” Grignon says. </p>


<p id="5Pk9iX">The first calls from an Apple phone were not, it turns out, made on the sleek touchscreen interface of the future but on a steampunk rotary dial. “We came very close,” Ording says. “It was, like, we could have finished it and made a product out of it… But then I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ” </p>


<p id="DUq06v">“For us on the hardware team, it was great experience,” David Tupman says. “We got to build RF radio boards, it forced us to select suppliers, it pushed us to get everything in place.” In fact, elements of the iPod phone wound up migrating into the final iPhone; it was like a version 0.1, Tupman says. For instance: “The radio system that was in that iPod phone was the one that shipped in the actual iPhone.” </p>


<h1 id="vbHFHx"><strong>Hands Off </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="XHsJVN">The first time Fadell saw P2’s touch-tablet rig in action, he was impressed — and perplexed. “Steve pulled me in a room when everything was failing on the iPod phone and said, ‘Come and look at this.’ ” Jobs showed him the ENRI team’s multitouch prototype. “They had been getting, in the background, the touch Mac going. But it wasn’t a touch Mac; literally, it was a room with a PingPong table, a projector, and this thing that was a big touchscreen,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="zm5jwz">“This is what I want to put on the phone,” Jobs said.</p>


<p id="ksDXAz">“Steve, sure,” Fadell replied. “It’s not even close to production. It’s a prototype, and it’s not a prototype at scale — it’s a prototype table. It’s a research project. It was like eight percent there,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="6AOyel">David Tupman was more optimistic. “I was like, ‘Oh, wow, yeah, we <em>have</em> to find out a way to make this work.’ ” He was convinced the engineering challenges could be solved. “I said, ‘Let’s just sit down and go through the numbers and let’s work it out.’ ” </p>

<p id="ch7Swa">The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which project to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, had an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons. The BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an email client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else, including Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way forward, Schiller became the lone holdout. </p>


<p id="Kj0w3V">He “just sat there with his sword out every time, going, ‘No, we’ve got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.’ And he wouldn’t listen to reason as all of us were like, ‘No, this works now, Phil.’ And he’d say, ‘You gotta have a hard keyboard!’ ” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="jjj48q">Schiller didn’t have the same technological acumen as many of the other execs. “Phil is not a technology guy,” Brett Bilbrey, the former head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group, says. “There were days when you had to explain things to him like a grade-school kid.” Jobs liked him, Bilbrey thinks, because he “looked at technology like middle America does, like Grandma and Grandpa did.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="X53DEg"><q>“[Schiller] was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="dJIX5l">When the rest of the team had decided to move on multitouch and a virtual keyboard, Schiller put his foot down. “There was this one spectacular meeting where we were finally going in a direction,” Fadell says, “and he erupted.” </p>


<p id="mCw0W1">“We’re making the wrong decision!” Schiller shouted. </p>


<p id="VEtYJ5">“Steve looked at him and goes, ‘I’m sick and tired of this stuff. Can we get off of this?’ And he threw him out of the meeting,” Fadell recalls. Later, he says, “Steve and he had it out in the hallway. He was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.” </p>


<p id="pqb4QD">That cleared it up: the phone would be based on a touchscreen. “We all know this is the one we want to do,” Jobs said in a meeting, pointing to the touchscreen. “So let’s make it work.” </p>


<h1 id="5d0IZm"><strong>Round Two </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="WBvz7O">“There was a whole religious war over the phone” between the iPod team and the Mac OS crew, one former Apple executive told me. When the iPod wheel was ruled out and the touch ruled in, the new question was how to build the phone’s operating system. This was a critical juncture — it would determine whether the iPhone would be positioned as an accessory or as a mobile computer. </p>


<p id="I0MFQM">“Tony and his team were arguing we should evolve the operating system and take it in the direction of the iPod, which was very rudimentary,” Richard Williamson says. “And myself and Henri and Scott Forstall, we were all arguing we should take OS X” — Apple’s main operating system, which ran on its desktops and laptops — “and shrink it down.” </p>


<p id="hmTfnD">“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do,” Williamson says. </p>


<p id="9q0gIE">The NeXT mafia saw an opportunity to create a true mobile computing device and wanted to squeeze the Mac’s operating system onto the phone, complete with versions of Mac apps. They knew the operating system inside and out — it was based on code they’d worked with for over a decade. “We knew for sure that there was enough horsepower to run a modern operating system,” Williamson says, and they believed they could use a compact ARM processor — Sophie Wilson’s low-power chip architecture — to create a stripped-down computer on a phone. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="uNCLQq"><q>“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="9pGmob">The iPod team thought that was too ambitious and that the phone should run a version of Linux, the open-source system popular with developers and open-source advocates, which already ran on low-power ARM chips. “Now we’ve built this phone,” says Andy Grignon, “but we have this big argument about what was the operating system it should be built on. ’Cause we were initially making it iPod-based, right? And nobody cares what the operating system in an iPod is. It’s an appliance, an accessory. We were viewing the phone in that same camp.” </p>


<p id="aO1bth">Remember, even after the iPhone’s launch, Steve Jobs would describe it as “more like an iPod” than a computer. But those who’d been in the trenches experimenting with the touch interface were excited about the possibilities it presented for personal computing and for evolving the human-machine interface. “There was definitely discussion: This is just an iPod with a phone. And we said, no, it’s OS X with a phone,” Henri Lamiraux says. “That’s what created a lot of conflict with the iPod team, because they thought they were the team that knew about all the software on small devices. And we were like, no, okay, it’s just a computer.” </p>


<p id="aCf10o">“At this point we didn’t care about the phone at all,” Williamson says. “The phone’s largely irrelevant. It’s basically a modem. But it was ‘What is the operating system going to be like, what is the interaction paradigm going to be like?’ ” In that comment, you can read the roots of the philosophical clash: The software engineers saw P2 not as a chance to build a phone, but as an opportunity to use a phone-shaped device as a Trojan horse for a much more complex kind of mobile computer. </p>


<h1 id="bgQhz3">
<strong>The Incredible Shrinking Operating System</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="ayNIYO">When the two systems squared off early on, the mobile-computing approach didn’t fare so well.</p>


<p id="TxrqhX">“Uh, just the load time was laughable,” Andy Grignon says. Grignon’s Linux option was fast and simple. “It’s just kind of <em>prrrrrt</em> and it’s up.” When the Mac team first got their system compiling, “it was like six rows of hashtags, <em>dink-dink-dink-dink-dink</em>, and then it just sat there and it would shit the bed for a little bit, and then it would finally come back up and you’d be like, Are you even kidding me? And this is supposed to be for a device that just turns on? Like, for real?” </p>


<p id="JdK3Yy">“At that point it was up to us to prove” that a variant of OS X could work on the device, Williamson says. The mafia got to work, and the competition heightened. “We wanted our vision for this phone that Apple was going to release to become a reality,” Nitin Ganatra says. “We didn’t want to let the iPod team have an iPod-ish version of the phone come out before.” </p>


<p id="ULLgJv">One of the first orders of business was to demonstrate that the scrolling that had wowed Jobs would work with the stripped-down operating system. Williamson linked up with Ording and hashed it out. “It worked and looked amazingly real. When you touched the screen, it would track your finger perfectly, you would pull down, it would pull down.” </p>


<p id="87p4aF">That, Williamson says, put the nail in the Linux pod’s coffin. “Once we had OS X ported and these basic scrolling interactions nailed, the decision was made: We’re not going to go with the iPod stack, we’re going to go with OS X.” </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="CKB6ls">The software for the iPhone would be built by Scott Forstall’s NeXT mafia; the hardware would go to Fadell’s group. The iPhone would boast a touchscreen and pack the power of a mobile computer. That is, if they could get the thing to work. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pns7wd">For eight seconds, an eerie orange glow lit up the mesas and canyons of western Colorado with the intensity of the full Moon. Locals reported a bluish orb in the sky that burst into a yellow ball of flames and dissipated over the Gunnison Gorge, located 10 miles east of the city of Montrose. Moments later, they heard a crackling followed by a low rumble.</p>


<p id="Emz5qw">One observer was standing on a ridge when he felt his entire body reverberate, as if from the blast of a powerful speaker. Another man was driving west when he saw the flash in his rear-view mirror. He veered off the road, popped open his car door, and craned his neck to the horizon. “There was a bright light that just hung in the same spot with sparklers trailing off,” he recounted shortly afterward. Some residents called 911, believing they had witnessed a plane or helicopter crash.</p>


<p id="WD8AjL">That fireball in the sky on Thanksgiving Day 2002 turned out to be a rock from space. A video camera on the roof of Montrose High School, part of a state-wide astronomical network, captured images of the extraterrestrial object as it pierced the atmosphere at a speed of <a href="http://www.cloudbait.com/science/fireball20021128.html">36,000 miles per hour</a>. The hunk of rock was about the size of a mini fridge, and when it flared up 60 miles over the Rocky Mountains, it did so with the force of 2.4 tons of TNT.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Nqsp3b"><q>When it flared up 60 miles over the Rocky Mountains, the meteorite did so with the force of 2.4 tons of TNT</q></aside></div>


<p id="EwgNqr">Montrose (population 19,132) isn’t the kind of place where you’d expect a lot of amateur astronomers. Founded in the late 1800s as a hub for mining and ranching, it had become just another windblown town in the West, filled with empty storefronts, mobile homes, and veterans cashing Social Security checks. But after Montrosians caught a glimpse of that shooting star, they kept looking up. An even brighter meteor burst over Main Street in May 2004. Four years later, another big one streaked across the sky to the northwest.</p>


<p id="KvouLZ">When a space rock passes through the atmosphere and lands on the ground, it’s called a meteorite. Finding one is a little like picking up a winning lottery ticket. Some of them may be worth just a few cents per gram. Others can sell for thousands of dollars. Meteorite hunters naturally started searching the hillsides above Montrose for debris, but most left empty-handed.</p>


<p id="AkTD3u">Then, one afternoon in 2010, a meteorite salesman named Blaine Reed swung by Mr. Detector, a roadside prospecting supply store stocked with gold panning kits, rock hammers, and metal detectors. When customers came in with puzzling rocks they had found, the owner, a genial Seventh-day Adventist named Dave Lehmann, stashed them behind the counter for Reed to appraise.</p>

<p id="n3XUw0">Reed, who is 54, mostly evaluated these rocks as a public service. But as one of the preeminent meteorite dealers in the country, he was always on the lookout for something valuable to come in over the transom. “You never know,” he says. Reed is a tall, anxious man with thinning hair, whose darting eyes are hidden behind a set of tinted bifocals. He speaks in a frenetic, nasal drone, like a robot with a deviated septum.</p>


<p id="qKNBvh">Reed made a name for himself in 1998 when he marketed the first “affordable” moon rocks to private collectors: one-tenth of a gram of lunar breccia from Libya went for $2,600. With only a bachelor’s degree in geology, Reed is not academically trained to study meteorites. But decades of experience have given him the gift of identifying specimens at a glance with the certainty of any credentialed scientist.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="D64mEC"><q>The fact is that most people who think they have a winning lottery ticket probably don’t</q></aside></div>


<p id="e53BAq">Lehmann passed Reed a nugget about the size of a prune with a wrinkled, silvery appearance. Reed furrowed his brow and ran his fingers along its ridges before tossing it back on the counter like a wad of chewing gum. </p>


<p id="UGxpPk">Lehmann said that a Montrose man named Steven Duane Curry had brought it in along with a glossy postcard he had printed, hoping to sell it on consignment. The card said that it was a remnant of the Thanksgiving Day “bolide” from 2002. “Only 75lbs, or 35kgs, of the estimated 200lb meteoroid, have been recovered,” the card stated. “This meteorite will be recognized as the first of its type to be recovered on US soil.” </p>


<p id="lkZdUl">Reed let out a howl. The fact is that most people who think they have a winning lottery ticket probably don’t. Curry’s specimen was what veterans in the business like to call a “meteorwrong.” It looked like a melted piece of man-made steel. Reed advised Lehmann to send Curry on his way.</p>


<p id="sVhx1j">Reed figured that Curry would just blow away like so much cosmic dust. Instead, Reed’s rejection of Curry’s treasure would become the opening move in a twisted game that transformed Curry in ways neither of them could have imagined. Over the next eight years, Curry went from a passionate rockhound with a corny sense of humor to a disturbed man trapped inside a distorted universe of his own making. He rejected not only the standards of scientific evidence but also the most fundamental principles of our legal system. This unlikely trajectory would ultimately leave Reed in desperate fear for his safety and Curry sitting in a jail cell in the desert, facing the rest of his life locked up.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="Khu3oc">The first video showed up on YouTube in May 2011. It begins with a view of firewood stacked in front of a stove, and then it sweeps over to a table covered in rocks. The camera tilts up to reveal a man with glasses and a white push-broom mustache. He picks up a rock and mugs for the camera. “Good morning, folks. I’m Steve Curry. I’m a meteoriticist here in western Colorado,” he says with the drawl of a High Plains cowboy.</p>


<p id="HJcuLU">Today, he’s going to show his viewers how a wet chemistry kit from the internet can identify the presence of nickel in a rock — a sign that it could be from outer space. After rubbing a rock with a vinegar-soaked Q-tip, he touches it to a second Q-tip with dimethylglyoxime. “What we shall see is a nice rosy pink-red right there. You can see it,” he says, though, in fact, you can’t see it all. “We’ve had it rosier,” he admits, “but still, we’re getting pink in there.”</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="CrSwbj"><q>“You can see it,” he says, though, in fact, you can’t see it all</q></aside></div>


<p id="JDKweC">Those test results were a turning point, a moment when Curry could see something that the rest of the world couldn’t. Never mind that Curry had quite possibly contaminated his rudimentary test by double-dipping his Q-tips. He and his wife, Sandra Lee Tyler, were both caught up in the excitement, imagining how they might capitalize on their meteorite bounty.</p>


<p id="4uVuBI">The couple, both in their late 60s, were living out their golden years in a green ranch-style home on Dave Wood Road in the hills southwest of Montrose, surrounded by federally owned land. To the south were the snow-capped peaks of the San Juans. To the east was the Black Canyon, which would soon be designated a National Park. To the west, the Uncompahgre National Forest billowed out toward the red rock canyons of Utah.</p>


<p id="Sh83JC">Curry, the third of seven children, grew up nearby in the farming community of Paonia. His father was a high school teacher and basketball coach, and his mother was a homemaker. Compared to his brothers, who were All-Conference basketball stars, Steve was an ordinary lump of a man, an Earth rock who found his own way to stand out through his creativity and good humor. After serving two tours in Vietnam, he got an art degree, worked gigs as a coal miner and truck driver, and sold oil paintings of the American West, signing them with the pseudonym Charles Wesley Heileg.</p>

<p id="BSGsgs">In the early 1990s, Curry and his brothers started a company to produce a board game called<em> </em>I.N.I.T.I.A.L. Response, which was based on a game they played as boys. <em>Games </em>magazine picked it as one of its top 100 games two years in a row, but the company fizzled. Curry, however, wasn’t one to give up. He designed more than 40 games in all, including Hawaiian Glyphs, Stack Gammon, and Wild Cod<em> </em>(“The only card game played Just for the Halibut”), which he sold under the company name C.W. Heileg. None of them made much money. Once Curry met Tyler in 2001, she says that they largely lived off savings from her work as a dietician. </p>


<p id="kdY0pg">After Curry and Tyler bought their Montrose home in 2006, Curry, who had no formal training in geology, found rocks that he suspected came from space. In a letter he sent me, he explained that he was rekindling an interest he had developed from his grandfather, a “Rockhound-Extraordinaire,” who had a lapidary shop in his basement. To suss out iron meteorites, Curry would dangle a rare-earth magnet from a lanyard as he tromped through the woods around his home. His finds would be washed of their rust, polished in a rock tumbler, or sawed in half to expose their cross section.</p>


<p id="kByiWY">Scientists classify meteorites based on their make-up. About 94 percent are stony meteorites, which are composed of the same stuff that’s in beach sand and microchips — silicate minerals like quartz and feldspar. The remaining 6 percent are iron-nickel meteorites, which are thought be derived from the molten cores of aborted planets that end up breaking apart. When Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, these same metals sank to its core, where they remain trapped 1,800 miles below the rocky crust. That’s why naturally occurring iron-nickel alloys on the Earth’s surface are pretty much guaranteed to be meteorites.</p>


<p id="KVHEiD">The commercial meteorite trade caters mostly to a small but fervid group of hobbyist collectors who will pay extraordinary prices to get a piece of the latest finds. In recent years, <a href="http://www.kgns.tv/content/news/Meteorites-are-in-High-Demand-409771305.html">demand for space stones</a> has come from wealthy Chinese collectors, who seem to want the largest showpiece they can get their hands on, and from tech bros, who pine for the rarest ones.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="ymDZEH"><q>“There’s nothing quite like a new discovery, even if the discovery involves nothing more than learning a bit more about ourselves.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="C3NhkQ">Meteorite collecting took off during the space race of the late 1950s and peaked in the 1980s when rock star dealers like Robert Haag established networks of “meteorite hunters” to scout for rocks. This mostly meant getting the word out to Midwestern farmers to send them specimens they plowed up in their fields. But it also produced the likes of Michael Farmer, a Tucson-based meteorite hunter who has chased shooting stars in 80 countries and once spent two months in a prison in Oman for illegal mining. (He raced up to Montrose within days of the Thanksgiving Day fireball.) More recently, nomads in the Sahara Desert have become a prized source of new material. The International Meteorite Collectors Association lists 455 members on its website, but the modest size of the market means that only a few dozen or so dealers around the world are making a full-time living off of meteorites alone.</p>


<p id="jniFXa">The more Steve Curry studied meteorites, the less he could understand how scientists and dealers could claim that they were uncommon. He found them everywhere he looked: in streambeds, on hilltops, even at the Sunset Mesa disc golf course south of town. He bought a copy of the 1973 book <em>Find a Falling Star </em>by Harvey H. Nininger, a self-taught scientist who founded the American Meteorite Museum in Tucson. Curry came to believe he was carrying on Nininger’s legacy. “It is an amazing science, and I’m enjoying being involved in it,” he wrote in an email to Randy Korotev, a meteorite researcher at Washington University in St. Louis. “Perhaps you will agree, that there’s nothing quite like a new discovery, even if the discovery involves nothing more than learning a bit more about ourselves.”</p>

<p id="fwsX9P">Scientists, collectors, and dealers in the meteorite community can have a fraught relationship with one another. Though some scientists resent the idea of potential research material being locked away by private owners, the meteorite trade has also surfaced new scientifically valuable material. Korotev doubted Curry’s finds, telling him they lacked the hallmark features of meteorites. Some appeared to be basalts, which are volcanic in origin. Others were likely breccia, a rock conglomerate that exists on both the Earth and the Moon. “If it’s driving down the highway and it has 4 tires, 2 headlights, and a trunk, then it’s probably an automobile, not an alien spacecraft,” Korotev wrote Curry.</p>


<p id="FpTkMO">Curry brushed off the skepticism. He saw it as a dispute among gentlemen — one man’s learned opinion against another’s. He shopped around for an expert who would vindicate him, but in the end, he found none. Nevertheless, Curry listed purported meteorites he collected in Colorado, Utah, and Texas on eBay. One pound of moon rock was listed for $601,500. A piece of Mars was going for $1,414,000. Those prices would have been astronomical even if the rocks had, in fact, been astronomical.</p>


<p id="bs2SOJ">But in Montrose at least, Curry counted as an expert. He developed a following, delivering standing room-only talks to adults and schoolchildren at the Montrose library and in churches and museums. During presentations, he would sometimes sport a black leather vest and bolo tie, channeling a banker from a John Wayne Western. He peppered his lectures with technical words like “regmaglypt,” the thumbprint impression caused when hot atmospheric gases scour the surface of a meteorite.</p>

<p id="9Oyn6b">“He was extremely knowledgeable,” says Robert Stollsteimer, who became what he calls “a groupie.” An elderly woman in Olathe, the next town over, became convinced her yard was jam-packed with meteorites, and she donated $15,000 to Curry so he could buy meteorite-testing gear. Channel 8 news in nearby Grand Junction ran a story about Curry discovering the first moon rocks in North America. It was startling, to say the least. “He’s found outlines of crustaceans, snails and sea worms inside his meteors,” the report said. “Proof of alien life.”</p>


<p id="1YPWT7">Though Curry had yet to make any considerable proceeds off of meteorite sales, he began to picture himself as a captain of industry, a railroad tycoon of yore who could give back to his frontier town. He established the Osirius Foundation with plans to funnel proceeds from his meteorites to charity. He handed out meteorites to people he met like they were party favors. He also donated five specimens to the Montrose County Historical Society, which, according to the receipt he scribbled out, were worth $58,994,500.</p>


<p id="WEQYyW">During a meeting of the Montrose City Council, Curry gave a presentation about his vision for the town’s future. “I would like to present to the Council, an economic stimulus proposal involving an abundance of natural resources found here,” he wrote in a handout he distributed that day. He spoke of building a meteorite museum in town and creating a fenced-in park atop Sunset Mesa, where visitors could observe meteorites <em>in situ</em>. “With your assistance, support, and cooperation,” he declared, “I would like to market Montrose, and Montrose County, as the new ‘Meteorite Capital of the World.’”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="cQKZTl">The rabbits scattered as Blaine Reed and his twin brother Blake rumbled onto the gravel drive of their shared property about 15 miles north of Montrose. Their treeless lot looks like an outpost on Mars, with a series of tan, prefab habitations that are the same color as the powdery soil underfoot. Between their homes — decked out with solar panels, satellite dishes, and a ham radio antenna — sits a dirt runway for their ultralight airplane. </p>


<p id="O8TIfA">The twins had just returned from an exhausting week at the September 2011 Denver Gem and Mineral Show, but there was no time to rest. As a member of the International Meteorite Collectors Association, Reed adhered to a strict code of ethics, vowing to uphold a high bar of professionalism in the identification and verification of meteorites. “The membership maintains this high standard by monitoring each other’s activities for accuracy,” the code states. “One of the hardest things is to get people to believe the meteorites you’re selling are real,” Reed says. Those who break the code need to be reprimanded.</p>


<p id="bYqqsW">Reed and his colleagues had gotten Curry kicked off of eBay multiple times for his faux meteorites, and, each time, Curry lashed out with increasing vitriol. His purported meteorites, or “Curry-ites,” were now popping up in shops in Montrose, Telluride, Glenwood Springs, and Grand Junction. The last straw for Reed came during the Denver gem show in the form of an email titled “High Noon Challenge” that Curry blasted to the meteorite community:</p>


<blockquote><p id="xtVBGj">Hi Boys &amp; Girls; You’ve all had a wonderful time, over the past couple of years, in trying to denounce my research, attacking my integrity, defaming my character, and, most importantly, making absolute fools of yourselves! I’ve allowed this, and I’ve exhibited a great deal of tolerance for your highly unprofessional, and grossly unethical behavior, but, I will not tolerate your abuse of my family, friends, and business colleagues. YOU HAVE CROSSED THE LINE FOR THE LAST TIME!!</p></blockquote>


<p id="wCmZp9">Curry proposed that Reed meet him at the Montrose Library after the Denver gem show for a “duel.” Reed was one of the country’s only dealers at the time who owned an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF), a $40,000 device that looks like a raygun and can identify the chemical elements in a geologic sample within seconds. “Mr. Blaine Reed must show up at this lecture, armed with his new toy, as in his XRF hand-held analyzer,” Curry wrote. “I, too, will show up with our XRF hand-held analyzer, which will be operated by an experienced geologist from Western Colorado.” The two men were to compare one of Curry’s purported North American moon rocks with a verified moon rock from Morocco, and the results would be judged by a jury made up of the people of Montrose. If vindicated, Curry wrote, Reed must abandon the meteorite business forever.</p>


<p id="sCdWFa">Reed was flabbergasted by the gall of this guy.<em> </em>Who did Curry think he was challenging his authority, his livelihood? Reed was no wheeler-dealer. He was a man of science and integrity. He’d had a passion for meteorites since the night he sat in the back seat of his parent’s car suffering from strep throat and caught sight of a falling star. He was the only one who saw it. It was his and his alone, an incandescent umbilicus connecting this seven-year-old boy to the firmament. In the sixth grade, Reed finally got his hands on his first meteorite, a flake that crumbled off a planetarium specimen. “Boy, I held tight to that,” he says. It didn’t look like much. Most meteorites don’t. What captivated Reed, both then and now, was its origin. “It’s something from another world,” he says.</p>

<p id="Ark3dR">Reed was willing, in principle, to accept Curry’s challenge. But he had a better idea. To put it into action, though, he knew he would have to enlist his twin brother. Blake, who is three minutes older than Blaine, has a few more strands of gray hair and wears his owlish glasses perched on the tip of his nose. While Blaine is the Luddite, who had only recently graduated from a typewriter to a Windows laptop, Blake is the electronics whiz, who carries his soldering iron around like a security blanket.</p>


<p id="gFSl0P">The twins got to work on their plan. First, they published “wanted” ads in the <em>Montrose Daily Press</em> and papered the area with flyers offering $10 for Curry-ites they could analyze. A half-dozen specimens were dropped off at Mr. Detector, and they zapped them with the XRF, lending hard numbers to back up Reed’s trained eyes. They were Earth rocks, plain and simple. Still, those results wouldn’t be enough. They needed to send a powerful message to Curry to make him stop hawking his fakes. “Play time is over and I mean business!” Reed wrote Curry in an email.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="6zH4Jc"><q>“Play time is over and I mean business!”</q></aside></div>


<p id="YGsXfc">On the morning of October 1st, Blake looked down at his wrist and pressed “record” on his old-school spy watch with a video camera hidden in its analog face. Blaine, Blake, and Blaine’s wife, Linda Sakurai, strutted into Main Street Minerals &amp; Beads in downtown Grand Junction. As a jazzy tune played over a boombox, they passed a few amethyst geodes and approached a large glass case displaying rocks with magnets affixed to them. “Montrose Iron/Nickel Meteorites” read the label. On a lower shelf sat a cheesy-looking certificate of authenticity signed by Curry. </p>


<p id="JZqPsJ">“I wanted to look at the Montrose iron meteorites,” Blaine said to an employee at the counter. “I was here last week, and my wife says she’ll give me one as a present.”</p>


<p id="UPQ1BN">One of the shop workers opened the case, and Reed picked up the smallest specimen he could find, a 6-gram Curry-ite about the size of a postage stamp. “This has been documented,” she assured him, having taken Curry at his word. “It’s a plessitic octahedrite, which I don’t know a whole lot about. But apparently, it’s super, super rare.” She handed him a printout purporting to show that it didn’t just contain nickel but also precious metals like gold and platinum. Plessitic octahedrites, Reed knew, were among the least-common iron-nickel meteorites, unique in having needle-like structures in them. The price for this small nugget was $645.90.</p>


<p id="zpmn25">“This is a lot of money,” Reed exhaled theatrically. Still, his wife pulled out her Visa card, and they hurried out of the store with their purchase.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="lHUReA">A few weeks later, Ryan Piotrowski, an officer with the Grand Junction Police Department, heard his sergeant joking about a little black rock that had landed on his desk. It was the classic crap case that none of the veterans on the force wanted to touch: inscrutable paperwork and witnesses spewing gibberish. But Piotrowski, a young, clean-cut transplant from Wisconsin, had just started watching the television series <em>Meteorite Men</em> and was intrigued. This Reed character, who claimed he had been defrauded, actually seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>


<p id="GaLn6E">Not only had Reed’s XRF machine shown that the Curry-ite had no nickel, but Reed went one step further: he had sent shavings to a professional lab where analysts used a machine that heats up materials with a 10,000-degree plasma torch. Using a process called inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the device then identifies the shaving’s atomic makeup by the light it emits, like a tiny, dying supernova. The lab confirmed Reed’s findings: the 6-gram nugget Curry was trying to sell as precious metal from outer space was just some carbon steel with a vanishing trace of nickel in it. Reed shared those results with Officer Piotrowski.</p>

<p id="ZcnF1K">On January 26th, 2012, Piotrowski invited Curry to meet him at the station for a voluntary interview. Curry schlepped along a couple of doorstop-sized rocks and a binder full of Wikipedia printouts that he opened on the table between them. “Thanks for coming in,” Piotrowski said.</p>


<p id="PsQIQD">“I could probably spend more time on meteorites than you want to spend,” Curry joked. </p>


<p id="ydyi1b">But Piotrowski wasn’t in the mood for one of Curry’s lectures. “I hope you’re picking up the fact that I’m pretty educated on meteorites,” he said as he took back control of the conversation. He wanted to focus on the question of how much nickel should be in a plessitic octahedrite. According to <em>The</em> <em>Cambridge Encyclopedia of Meteorites</em>, they should contain 13 to 16 percent nickel. The Curry-ites, however, had 10,000 times less than that. “You’re a smart man, do you really count 0.0008 percent nickel as nickel?” Piotrowski asked.</p>


<p id="NXbs45">“What we are experiencing here is a new science,” Curry said, “and I am part of the wave that is giving these scientists new information to go back and correct the things they have said.”</p>


<p id="wW7CKT">“What’s the minimum percent that’s acceptable?” Piotrowski asked.</p>


<p id="Wt6vOm">“Zero,” Curry replied. “If you don’t have to have nickel in a stony meteorite, then you don’t have to have nickel in an iron meteorite.”</p>


<p id="B4emd0">“Says you!” Piotrowski said. “What’s going to stop someone from picking up iron ore and saying it’s a meteorite?” </p>


<p id="h8JJD4">“Your moral ground,” Curry shot back.</p>

<p id="JmoeRw">Curry kept changing his story and couldn’t even say which analyses pertained to the suspect rock. “Both of them!” he would offer, invoking a quantum logic. Worst of all, he evidently believed his own falsehoods. When Piotrowski felt he had pinned down Curry as best he could, he whipped out a summons, charging him with misdemeanor theft and fraud for selling the bogus meteorite to Reed. Then, he looked Curry in the eye and delivered a stern warning. “You need to understand what you may think is right, may not be right anymore.”</p>


<p id="767k0c">Curry went to trial on October 18th, 2012, and the judge sentenced him to 500 hours community service and ordered him to pay a $1,500 fine along with restitution to Reed for defrauding him. Separately, the Colorado Attorney General enjoined him from advertising or selling any purported meteorites.</p>


<p id="xdy29x">The ruling devastated Curry. “He felt that his honor was at stake,” his younger sister, Sharon Smallwood, says. “No one is going to call me a fraud,” he told her. He refused to abide by the terms of his sentence and studied the law in order to launch his own appeal. </p>


<p id="RrXEPr">Curry also filed a 55-page lawsuit against Reed, alleging an international meteorite conspiracy that prevented new material from depressing prices. “<strong>‘Blaine Reed Meteorites,’</strong> like all other meteorite dealers, cloak themselves under the banner of <strong>‘SCIENCE,’</strong> as if meteorites are so incredibly rare, and are, somehow, “Scientifically Valuable,” he wrote. <strong>“The “Number #1 Priority’</strong> for all<strong> ‘Meteorite Research Scientists,’</strong> is to produce revenue for themselves, their research centers, and their home universities.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="Mc0YpW">As Curry’s filings were repeatedly rejected by the courts, he sensed that the injustice he faced reached far beyond meteorites and implicated the larger legal and political system that the country operates on. “He started doing a lot of internet researching and decided the government wasn’t really the government,” his wife says.</p>


<p id="hJgYkG">Like many rural Westerners, Curry always harbored suspicions about the powers that be. In the early 1990s, he had drawn political cartoons for a Libertarian newsletter called <em>Common Sense. </em>The cartoons showed taxpayers in gallows, beheaded by judges, or boiled up in “liberty stew.” Now, Curry began devouring the writings of a woman in Alaska named Anna Von Reitz, who believed in an alternative legal system that dates back to the mid-19th century. Every individual, Curry came to believe, was a sovereign citizen and had the right to create their own courts and juries following common law.</p>

<p id="EVfPob">On December 8th, 2013, 14 people showed up for another talk Curry was giving at the Montrose library. This time, the topic was not meteorites. Curry was recruiting volunteers for a common law grand jury in Montrose County. He stood at the front of the room in a black vest and tie, next to an artist’s easel with a large pad of notes on it. Judges, he told the audience, were beholden to the people. “A breach of the trust and faith of the people,” Curry explained. “You can indict them for that.”</p>


<p id="fG5YbK">An old man raised his hand. “Steve?” he said. Curry turned toward him and placed his hand on his chin. “A breach of that oath can also be treason?” the man suggested.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="m2sxtw"><q>He then clenched his hand into a fist as though he was holding a noose</q></aside></div>


<p id="ydqPvf">“Absolutely,” Curry said.</p>


<p id="a5di8j">“What’s the punishment for treason?” he asked.</p>


<p id="kxMVCx">“Treason is hanging,” Curry replied. “We’re going to have a lot of indictments on treason, I can guarantee you that.” He then clenched his hand into a fist as though he was holding a noose. He hoisted it above his head and rolled his eyes back.</p>


<p id="2kELab">It was just one more instance of Curry’s defiance of the law. For months he had  refused to serve his community service or pay his fines. Montrose county Sheriff Rick Dunlap decided he needed to act. Two weeks after the meeting, as snow blanketed the ground, Dunlap sent his SWAT team out to Dave Wood Road to arrest Curry. The sheriff figured a night in jail might knock some sense into the man. But when Curry got out, he was livid. “The WAR has begun,” he wrote a friend. “It could be a good time to call in the Militia!”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="0v6Fv5">Steve Curry stood in front of a hay bale with a jeweler’s loupe hanging from his neck and a combat veteran cap on his head. Five months had passed since his arrest, and a woman was interviewing him for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FznkiV_04OM">YouTube broadcast</a> of a sovereign citizens group known as the Citizens Action Network. “Steve is a gentleman who has been fighting some of the corruption — a lot of corruption — for quite some time,” she said. “We’re going to have Steve tell you a little bit about why he’s here.”</p>


<p id="UTXCm9">“Here” happened to be the Bundy Ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. The ranch’s owner, a cattleman named Cliven Bundy, had been grazing his herd on federal lands for more than 20 years, amassing over $1 million in unpaid permit fees. Bundy didn’t believe the federal government held sway over this property, or any land in Nevada. When the US Bureau of Land Management began rounding up his cattle on April 5th, 2014, Bundy’s ranch became a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/bundy-brothers-acquitted-in-takeover-of-oregon-wildlife-refuge.html">magnet for anti-government protesters</a> and armed militia members.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="irZXnc"><q>“Guess what the Bundys have here? A meteoritic or asteroidal deposit of a particular element.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="wDBF6Y">Curry had become a sort of traveling preacher, delivering seminars to scruffy white men with rifles hanging from their shoulders. He had a peculiar idea about why the government was coming down hard on the Bundys. “Every mining concern around the globe is centered around a meteoritic or asteroidal deposit,” he told his interviewer. “Guess what the Bundys have here? A meteoritic or asteroidal deposit of a particular element, and it’s called magnesium dolomite … which is the metallic igniter for jet fuel, rocket fuel.” Curry pulled out a small white box, opening it to reveal a metallic rock. “Oh yeah, this is an iron meteorite I discovered in western Colorado,” he said. “This is what that cabal came after <em>me</em> for.” </p>


<p id="PX9Q2p">Sometime in May or early June, Curry moved on to Montana, where he stayed with Ryan Payne, a sovereign he had crossed paths with at the Bundy Ranch who led a militia called the Oath Keepers. Curry believed that Payne, too, <a href="http://missoulanews.com/news/freedom-fighter/article_ebaaf25e-d083-551d-bd85-57aafe1e2db8.html">had meteorites around his</a> residence. Authorities began to take note of Curry’s new acquaintances. The cops in Colorado warned Curry’s family that he could return home with an armed posse. </p>


<p id="9CgMSJ">“I will defend and protect my wife, my home, my property, my colleagues, and my friends, to the last breath!” Curry wrote in a letter to the judge who had presided over the meteorite case. In an email he sent to the <em>Montrose Daily Press</em>, he warned of “multiple fatalities” if his conviction wasn’t overturned. As for Reed, Curry threatened, he would soon be arrested for treason, and Curry had already made clear what the punishment for treason was. Reed promptly filed for a restraining order, and he, Blake, and Linda applied for concealed handgun permits. Officials told them there was nothing they could do but wait for Curry to act.</p>

<p id="EYUdrC">With sovereign citizens, it isn’t easy to determine whether someone has the intent to inflict physical harm or if they just have a bad case of verbal diarrhea. They have been known <a href="http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/nclr/vol93/iss4/4/">to move unpredictably</a> from so-called “paper terrorism” to real violence. The movement has its spiritual roots in the Posse Comitatus, a racist, anti-tax group that formed in 1969 and petered out in 1983 when a Posse member killed two US Marshals. </p>


<p id="ZqtPGt">A 2014 survey of law enforcement officials ranked sovereigns as the number one terrorist threat, above jihadis and neo-Nazis. In 2014, a Las Vegas couple declared a “revolution” inside a Cicis Pizza restaurant and shot two police officers. Terry Nichols, the co-conspirator of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, is a member of the sovereign movement; so is Jared Fogle, “the Subway Guy,” who was convicted of child molestation.</p>


<p id="HwOOOv">J.J. MacNab, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, says that the sovereign movement is like a cult or religion, though it has no single leader or doctrine. “You either believe or you don’t believe,” she says. It is made up of a people who don’t want to pay their taxes or have some festering grievance with the government, an employer, a bank, or some entity in a position of power. In addition to gumming up the legal system with nonsensical filings, they register liens against property owned by public officials, potentially harming their victims’ credit and tripping them up if they try to sell their land. “They believe that if they just go through this series of steps, they can force the nation back to what it was like 200 years ago,” MacNab says. By her estimate, there may be 100,000 hardcore sovereigns in the country, with another 200,000 who have tried out their schemes in courts. Curry, she says, “is a true believer.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="hAgIUn"><q>There was the Steve Curry who was named in legal papers, and then there was the <em>real </em>Steve Curry</q></aside></div>


<p id="zzaQmx">Curry, an avowed atheist, considered himself a rational man. But as his strange new faith evolved, he embraced the idea that there were two parallel universes. There were the courts and the cops and the science that most of us believe in. Then, there was Curry’s mirror reality, which revolved around its own axis and could cast off debris that sometimes collided with the real world and lead to peculiar contradictions. He denied the legitimacy of our courts, yet he insisted on filing documents with them. He refused to recognize the federal government, yet he also claimed to be a federally protected witness. There were also, naturally, two Steve Currys. There was the Steve Curry who was named in legal papers, and then there was the <em>real </em>Steve Curry, the “natural, living, breathing, feeling, and merciful, human being,” as he put it. For Curry, that distinction was critical: it meant that our system had no jurisdiction over him unless he consented to it.</p>


<p id="BUUhQf">After several months on the road, Curry returned to Montrose in the summer of 2014. He soon became one of the most influential sovereigns in Colorado, with a savant-like recall of legal precedents. His writing, even at its most menacing, could be playful and oddly persuasive. He appointed himself a Superior Judge of Colorado and participated in <a href="https://fourcornersdoctrine.wordpress.com/conference-calls-2/">a weekly conference call</a> where derelict taxpayers, small-time criminals, and cantankerous old men discussed plans to create an armed group of “Continental United States Marshals” to carry out their work.</p>


<p id="6vQGoL">Curry spent his days typing out liens and criminal complaints against the sovereign movement’s enemies across the state, stamping them with a red thumbprint — proof-positive that he was a real man. Sovereigns in Denver manufactured cop badges for themselves. “The overarching thing in the group is fighting the corruption of our state government,” says Steve Keno, a sovereign and a sheepherder who doesn’t like the City of Aspen Springs telling him he can’t run his animals on the city’s property.</p>

<p id="UnkuHe">Sheriff Dunlap received Curry’s missives almost daily and knew he had trouble on his hands. “We watched Dave Wood Road,” he says. “We watched it constantly.” One day, a call came into the station that Curry had barricaded himself in his home. “Steven has talked about committing suicide but would not do it himself,” the tipster reported. “He wanted law enforcement to kill him.” Over the summer, Dunlap’s deputies had noticed a poster appear under two antlers on a wooden signboard at the end of Curry’s driveway:</p>


<blockquote>
<p id="tocB9M"><strong>PUBLIC NOTICE</strong></p>
<p id="n9QlVr"><strong>BE IT KNOWN TO ALL MEN;</strong></p>
<p id="UwwZDz">(PRIVATE, CORPORATE, CIVILIAN, GOVERNMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; MILITARY)</p>
<p id="2zReE1">THIS LAND HAS BEEN RECLAIMED &amp; RESTORED, NOT AS BANK PROPERTY, GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, OR AS FOREIGN OWNED, BUT AS;</p>
<p id="hJMcza"><strong>PRIVATELY PATENTED, NATURAL, INHABITED LAND, PURSUANT TO THE GUADALUPE HIDALGO TREATY OF 1848</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<p id="yXXKZf">The poster went on to say that the property was “debt-free, un-encumbered, non-taxable.” Trespassers will be shot. “Survivors will be shot again.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Zrnfxc"><q>Trespassers will be shot. “Survivors will be shot again.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="QHFdRl">Curry and Tyler had quit paying their mortgage and property taxes. When the bank foreclosed on their home and put it up for auction, the Continental Marshals arrived with plans for a Bundy-style standoff. Bruce Doucette, another pretend judge who owned a computer store in Denver and hadn’t paid his taxes for many years, made several pilgrimages to Curry’s place, crashing in the guest room. At one point, one of Curry’s disciples stood in downtown Montrose waving a flag with the words “Fuck the Cops” on it. But the revolt lost momentum when Sheriff Dunlap arrested Curry one November afternoon when he was letting Tyler out the front gate.</p>


<p id="MEpFsE">This time, Curry would spend seven months in a jail cell in Grand Junction, defending his homestead with court filings penned in longhand. In January, Doucette headed up to Oregon to join Ryan Payne and two of Bundy’s sons during the 41-day armed standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which left one militia member dead.</p>


<p id="VTIzxx">In the end, none of Curry’s schemes to protect his home worked. In late May, Tyler and her three cats were evicted from Dave Wood Road. Their possessions were cleared out and piled up at the end of the driveway.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="U8DJrz">As the sun was setting on a Friday afternoon in September 2017, David Hunter, an investigator with the Otero County District Attorney’s Office and David Sanchez, a Sheriff’s deputy, arrived at the Oak Grove R.V. Park in the forested mountains of southeast New Mexico. Hunter and Sanchez were looking for a man who had recently tried to purchase a log cabin with a bogus financial document and had a felony arrest warrant in Colorado. The name on the warrant was Steven Curry.</p>


<p id="owoe6m">After Curry got out of jail in 2016, he and Tyler bought a 30-foot travel trailer that they towed behind his silver Dodge pickup, which still had a weathered sign on it that read “C.W. Heileg, The Gamemeister.” In January, he stumbled on an epic find out in Blythe, California, a town on the Arizona border. “A huge rubble-pile asteroid strewn field,” Curry put it in a letter to me. “There was an estimated 500k ton of heavy iron that landed 125-150 years ago!” He put some smaller meteorites up for sale at a shop in Quartzsite, Arizona. The shop’s owner, a man named Phil Bates, says he made it out to Curry’s crater a couple times. It was in a beautiful, remote area. “We had two people going out there and hauling a couple thousand pounds,” he says.</p>


<p id="DHIe7z">Then, on March 30th, law enforcement arrested Doucette and seven other sovereigns. The 40-count indictment included charges for extortion, retaliation against a judge, and criminal impersonation. It enumerated nearly 50 public officials that the group had allegedly terrorized. The would-be revolutionaries were nicknamed the “Colorado Eight,” and Curry’s name was added to the indictment shortly thereafter.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="gJZXOf"><q>Hunter leaned over and saw the glint of a stainless steel 0.44 magnum revolver</q></aside></div>


<p id="RgwNP0">After arriving at the RV park, Hunter and Sanchez proceeded toward the campsite where a green Subaru with a “No Trespassing” sign was parked. As they approached, they saw Tyler’s white bob of hair scurrying in one direction while the man they believed to be Curry boomeranged back to the RV. Sanchez shouted for Curry to stop, but he vanished into the RV. The two could hear him rustling around ominously. Hunter took cover behind the front fender of his vehicle. They waited.</p>


<p id="FGDHcg">When Curry poked his head back out of the doorway, he kept his body and hands hidden. During his time on the lam, he’d shaved off his mustache, and he looked wild-eyed and skeletal with liver-spotted skin and neck tendons taut as rubber bands. Hunter leaned over and saw the glint of a stainless steel 0.44 magnum revolver. It was a Ruger Redhawk, a handgun powerful enough to take down a grizzly. Curry told them he was willing to use it.</p>


<p id="55HtOv">Over the next hour, Hunter tiptoed out to a tree and tried to reason with Curry, but Curry insisted that their laws did not apply. “I’m a living man,” he said, “I’m not the person on your paper.” Curry stepped down from the vehicle and told them they were just slaves to a secret corporation that had a financial stake in every US citizen. Sanchez stifled a nervous laugh.</p>


<p id="ZlJxTl">As the sky darkened, Curry’s edge dulled. His voice quavered. “I’m tired,” he told the officers. He set his revolver on the ground, but still within reach. “It’s been an exhausting day,” he said. “I’ve been filing papers left and right in the Federal District Courts today. I have not stopped filing papers. I do it every day. I do it for everyone. I would file a paper for you, if you asked me to do that. I have rescued thousands of people in this country from false imprisonment.”</p>


<p id="D2rO2w">He went on.</p>


<p id="Qo60Qx">And on.</p>


<p id="ufp8ck">“Can I talk you out of a bottle of water?” Hunter interrupted. Curry reached for a 12-pack on the table next to him. Hunter saw his opening and sprinted forward, shutting the RV’s door and cutting Curry off from his revolver. Sanchez, meanwhile, raced in to subdue Curry, who pawed for a second firearm, a 0.38 special he had hidden in his waistband. The two men wrestled, and then Curry went for Sanchez’s own holster. “No, no no. Don’t you dare grab my gun,” Sanchez said.</p>


<p id="N8etbs">Hunter yanked Curry’s hand away from Sanchez’s firearm, but he was octopus-like, slippery. “You are sons of bitches,” Curry growled, “May you burn and rot in hell.”</p>


<p id="jsNLzn">A third officer on the scene pressed a taser against Curry’s chest and shoulder, but pulling the trigger would also send 1,000 volts arcing through Sanchez and Hunter. They were locked in a Mexican standoff. The action slowed. Curry panted and cursed under his breath. He flexed his arms, preventing a fourth officer from cuffing him.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="x2HeCU"><q>“I’d rather go out in a body bag,” Curry said. He had shit his pants</q></aside></div>


<p id="zCy01E">“I’m losing one hand,” Hunter cried. The scene exploded into chaos. Sanchez wrapped an arm around Curry’s neck and cinched it into a chokehold. The Montrose meteorite man let out a snort and, at last, went limp. They cuffed him and rolled him onto his stomach on the cold, bare Earth. “You are assholes,” he muttered.</p>


<p id="RbBT8q">“We just saved your life,” Sanchez replied.</p>


<p id="gvUMoz">“I’d rather go out in a body bag,” Curry said. He had shit his pants.</p>


<p id="RvFaiU">The cops delivered Curry to the jail in Alamogordo, New Mexico. He now faced charges in two states. In January, Curry’s brother Dave flew down to check on him. They conversed over a telephone for 45 minutes with a pane of glass between them. Dave mostly just listened to his brother — or at least the flesh-and-blood person who used to be his brother — argue that the charges against him weren’t valid. It was heartbreaking. “I knew that nothing I said was going to change his mind,” he says. “I just wanted to show him that I love him.”</p>

<p id="VdPn2t">While members of Curry’s posse have racked up prison sentences as long as 38 years, Curry appears bound for a different fate. A court-ordered psychological evaluation concluded that he has delusional disorder, a psychosis afflicting 20 to 30 out of every 100,000 people. People with the disorder develop profound, sometimes bizarre, convictions that they cling to with extraordinary tenacity. These convictions can lead them to develop a grandiose view of themselves and a sense that they are being persecuted. Some people may be genetically predisposed to it, causing an imbalance of the chemical signals in their brain, but it can be triggered by stress or an intense event. Insofar as the scientific literature is concerned, no evidence has ever linked delusion disorder with an extraterrestrial impact, but most everyone who knows Curry agrees that something in him changed the moment he got wrapped up in meteorites.</p>


<p id="IaABKJ">Earlier this month, a judge ruled that Curry is not fit to stand trial. An upcoming hearing will determine whether he is a menace to society and must remain locked up in a mental health facility, potentially for the rest of his life. Tyler, who suffers from bipolar disorder, refuses to accept Curry’s diagnosis and says it is just another way that the powers that be have muzzled her husband. “They found him incompetent because he doesn’t believe in what they believe in,” she says. His supporters in the sovereign community say that whatever happens to him, his name will live on. “He is a hero in my book,” says Robert Intlekofer in Louisville, Colorado. “He’ll be thought of more highly than George Washington.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="6WL7qc">The only time Blaine Reed ever met Curry in the flesh was during the trial in Grand Junction. He was standing at a urinal in the courthouse bathroom, and he looked over and saw a man with a white mustache in the next stall. He didn’t realize it was Curry until the trial began, and for the next five years, the Reeds lived in fear that the man with the white mustache would show up at their home unannounced. Blake installed a driveway alarm, a license plate reader, and several surveillance cameras on their property. </p>


<p id="S7k57X">“When I go into Montrose, I still carry a gun,” Blaine said on a recent afternoon. The Reeds have an armory that would make the NRA proud. In addition to a mini-revolver and a couple varmint rifles, Blaine keeps a 10-gauge shotgun over their front door. Blake has a semi-automatic shotgun that looks like it could stop a squad of stormtroopers. </p>


<p id="02X4Se">Even with Curry locked up, the good people of Montrose still want to believe they’re living in the Meteorite Capital. Locals guard their Curry-ites like family heirlooms. Duane Renfrow, a disabled veteran, called the Sheriff’s office when a photographer borrowed his specimen for a little longer than he was comfortable with. And Robert Stollsteimer still takes walks up to Sunset Mesa, where Curry wanted to establish a meteorite park. He likes to imagine an alt-universe where that vision came to fruition. Some of these people will tell you that Curry was “railroaded” by the courts, by the meteorite cartel, by Reed. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="GTxoIP"><q>“I’ve designed the board game,” he had written a friend once, “where they are the only losers.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="ETnxOX">It’s as though the whole town has been sucked into an orbit around a mad man, infected by a collective delusion that allows them to set aside science and the weight of expert opinion. Some claim ignorance of the facts, others simply refuse to abandon their past beliefs. Although Curry lost his battle against the meteorite community, he still won the war of public opinion. </p>


<p id="kwLXfG">“I’ve designed the board game,” he had written a friend once, “where they are the only losers.” He prevailed by playing upon doubt and mistrust that is still so pervasive in Montrose, and beyond. Curry capitalized on a flaw that is all too common: we are willing to hang on to certain irrational beliefs in the face of all evidence to the contrary. If a notion feels so good to us, we reason, then it must be right.</p>


<p id="eUPhjd">Being an objectivity crusader in a world like this can be a thankless job, as Reed has learned. Some of his colleagues thought he should have just kept his head down, and he ultimately resigned from the International Meteorite Collectors Association for fear of entangling them in his legal tussle. “I just did what had to be done,” he says. “It’s a relief to be back focusing on the business.”</p>


<p id="8Kjjhr">A couple years after the meteorite trial, Reed made the rounds at Mr. Detector, and Dave Lehmann handed him a half-pound rock with a fusion crust on it. A man named Eldon Surbeck was out hunting fossils when he found it on a talus slope east of Montrose. When Reed scratched the edge of the rock on a piece of white paper, it left a line like a pencil. Pencil lead, or graphite, only forms in an oxygen-free environment — that is, in space.</p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="FdTX8u">Reed bought the rock and sent a sample to the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Researchers there determined that it was a urelite, the first specimen of its kind recovered in Colorado and the fourth from the US. Christened the <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=61353">Sawtooth Mountain Meteorite</a>, Reed felt vindicated to confirm what he’d already suspected: this meteorite was real. He put it on display at the next gem show and made a few thousand dollars off it.</p>


<p id="Tu8gRy"><strong>Correction, 6/26/2018: </strong><em>This article has been updated to clarify that XRF stands for “X-ray fluorescence analyzer,” not “X-ray frequency analyzer.” In addition, although Terry Nichols was convicted of state charges related to his participation in the Oklahoma City Bombing in 2004, the bombing itself took place in 1995.</em></p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i7AKOq">When Rutam Vora was growing up in Vadodara, a city of about 2 million people near the western coast of India, his parents kept cool each summer by drenching bedsheets in water and hanging them in the windows of their house. When the scorching westerly wind known as the loo swept in and hit the sheets, the evaporating water absorbed the brunt of the heat. White chalk spread on the roof reflected the sun and dropped the temperature further. They were old methods of coping with the heat, like drinking lassis or chaas when “struck by the loo,” and they were effective. </p>


<p id="RzUYUz">But the weather, already hot, has been getting hotter. In the summer of 2015, it hit 114 degrees Fahrenheit in nearby Ahmedabad, where Vora works as a correspondent for <em>The Hindu</em>. The next summer, it passed 122 degrees, a record. It’s not uncommon for people to wrap their faces in wet cloth when venturing onto the furnace-like streets, and the wind is so hot it feels heavy. “For about a decade, the temperature has been going up,” Vora said. “But now, the last couple summers have been extreme, going beyond normal, bearable conditions.” </p>


<p id="3iKzZV">Earlier this year, Vora’s mother came down with a bacterial infection, and part of the doctor’s prescription was to stay cool. When the meteorological department warned of yet another punishing summer on the way, Vora decided it was time to buy an air conditioner. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="VIFrsM"><q>“The last couple summers have been extreme, going beyond normal, bearable conditions.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="r9F6x2">Across India, millions of people are making similar calculations.<strong> </strong>The share of Indians with air conditioning is still small, roughly 5 percent, but it’s growing fast.<strong> </strong>Rising incomes are making air conditioners more attainable, while rising temperatures are making them a necessity. “There are hundreds of millions of people for whom air conditioning doesn't seem like a luxury good,” said <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu/directory/michael-greenstone">Michael Greenstone</a>, director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “It can mean the difference between life and death.” </p>


<p id="lfGZiD">The cooling industry has found a ready market in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state of Gujarat. The city bakes each summer until the monsoon comes, at which point temperatures drop into the 90s and the humidity rises to stifling levels. Above the city’s winding streets, crowded with fleets of auto rickshaws and mopeds, billboards declare that every home deserves Hitachi cooling. Elsewhere<strong>,</strong> Panasonic ads extol the speed at which its “life conditioners” can cool a room. Apartment ads list AC first among amenities offered, and restaurants promise relief from the heat. Appliance shops along the roadside display the industry’s major players in big letters on their windows: Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Blue Star, Panasonic, General — the King of Cool, etched in glass with a crown — Daikin, Carrier. </p>


<p id="to9gau">The <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/benefits-leapfrogging-superefficiency">world is on track</a> to add 700 million new ACs by 2030, and 1.6 billion by 2050, largely in hot, developing countries like India and Indonesia. But the AC boom threatens to worsen the crisis it’s responding to, and widen the divide between those who can afford to stay cool and those left out in the heat. </p>


<p id="ZGqPQa">Air conditioners use refrigerants, and some of the most common types — hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs —  are powerful greenhouse gases, with thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. If HFC use continues to grow at its current pace, these chemicals could make up as much as <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10949.full.pdf">19 percent</a> of emissions by 2050. International initiatives are set to phase down the worst offenders, but air conditioners contribute to climate change in a second way: they consume a tremendous amount of electricity. Handling the growing load will require adding thousands of new power plants to the grid.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="AVASLN"><q>The AC boom threatens to worsen the crisis it’s responding to</q></aside></div>


<p id="FOpIGG">Air conditioners may be a double-edged tool, but some way of adapting to the rising heat will have to be found. High temperatures are already interfering with people’s ability to work, making people sick<strong>,</strong> and outright killing thousands. If heating is considered a basic requirement in Western countries, said Satish Kumar, executive chairman of the New Delhi-based <a href="http://www.aeee.in/">Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy</a>, it’s time to start thinking about cooling the same way. “We are saying that a basic level of thermal comfort in order to be productive, in order to sit comfortably in your home during the night, it should not be a question. Everybody should have access to that level of comfort.” </p>


<p id="BIr52w">Vora recalls the first time his family turned on their AC. His father announced that “from now onwards, the summer has gone from our life.” His mother asked the mechanic what temperature to keep it at to minimize electricity bills. “We survived so many decades, my father, and the people of his age, they would have hardly used AC,” Vora said. “But mine, and I imagine the next generation, they can’t live without it.” </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="2th0KW">One of the dangerous things about heat is the way it can sneak up on you. We deal with hot days all the time, and generally, they’re uncomfortable at worst. We wear light clothes, stand in the shade, fan ourselves, and commiserate. Our bodies work to stay at around 98.6 degrees: blood vessels dilate to move heat to the skin where it can be radiated into the air. If that’s not enough, we produce sweat, and heat gets absorbed turning it to vapor. But the effects of heat are nonlinear, and the line between discomfort and danger can be hard to detect. When the air becomes hotter than the body, skin stops radiating heat and starts to absorb it. If humidity is high, sweat can’t evaporate into the already saturated air. If you exert yourself, your core temperature will start to climb, and your body will struggle to bring it down. </p>


<p id="VE9IuB">Discomfort turns into fatigue, nausea, disorientation — symptoms of a fever, which is what it is. Skin turns bright red and sweat pours out as the body’s cooling systems go into overdrive. The heart starts to pound as it struggles to pump thickening blood, muscles spasm, sweat runs dry. At that point, the body is uncontrollably overheating. If its temperature isn’t brought down by ice baths and intravenous fluids, the cells’ mitochondria start to break down, organs fail, and death follows. </p>


<p id="makeH7">Seemingly small increases in global average temperatures hide a crucial shift in the extremes. What were uncomfortably hot days are becoming dangerously hot, dangerously hot days are becoming deadly ones. This shift is already perceptible in India: the mean summer temperature has risen less than a degree <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/6/e1700066.full">since 1960</a>, but heat waves that kill more than a hundred people have become more than twice as likely.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="YmCx8P"><q>“Our choices now are between bad and terrible.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="2jq9Jy">By the end of the century, almost half the people on Earth will face deadly heat and humidity for more than 20 days a year, according to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnclimate%2Fjournal%2Fv7%2Fn7%2Ffull%2Fnclimate3322.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a study</a> by Camilo Mora, a researcher at the University of Hawaii. And that’s the best-case scenario, with drastic reductions in carbon emissions. If emissions continue on their current trajectory, three-quarters of humanity will face deadly heat. Regions in the Persian Gulf, Bangladesh, and northeast India may become so hot and humid that, in the words of <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603322.full">another recent study</a>, they pass the “upper limit on human survivability,” deadly to anyone who ventures outside for more than a few hours. “Our choices now are between bad and terrible,” Mora said.  </p>


<p id="MjgZbO">For the past century, the best technology we’ve had for coping with heat has been the air conditioner. Air conditioners run refrigerant through coils in a loop. The refrigerant absorbs heat from inside a room as it turns from liquid to gas, then deposits heat outside as it’s condensed into liquid again. Because cooler air holds less moisture, water vapor condenses on the conditioner’s coils, lowering the humidity. (That condensate is the liquid that drops on city-dwellers’ heads in the summer.) </p>


<p id="5oTC0O">Though primarily thought of as a comfort appliance, ACs also save lives. As air conditioning spread through movie theaters, offices, and homes in the 20th century United States, <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684582">heat-related deaths</a> plummeted. (Without AC, heat and humidity in places like Florida can quickly become deadly, as became clear when several residents died at a nursing home after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/us/nursing-home-deaths-florida.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">Hurricane Irma</a>.) Air conditioning enabled the growth of hot cities like Phoenix and Houston, but it eventually became standard even in temperate regions, finding its way into <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2015/hc/php/hc7.1.php">87 percent</a> of US homes. </p>


<div><aside id="PGiyBs"><q>“AC has become a necessity, like a fan.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="BtASLb">Now air conditioning is spreading in India. Indians bought about 5 million room ACs last year, according to Frost and Sullivan, and the market is growing at 10 to 12 percent annually, with some of the more aggressive companies expanding far faster. International vendors are vying for a share of the market. General, a joint venture between Japan’s Fujitsu and the Emirati company ETA, is selling a “hyper tropical” line meant for temperatures up to 125 degrees, which it unveiled with a Bollywood performance. The Japanese company Daikin opened a factory in Rajasthan that’s pumping out half a million units a year and plans to double production. The industry is well aware that rising temperatures are juicing demand. (The tagline for this year’s air-conditioning exhibition in New Delhi was “witness global cooling.”) “Beyond a status symbol, AC has become a necessity, like a fan,” said Gaurav Mehtani, divisional manager at Daikin’s New Delhi office.</p>

<p id="OKkrVb">For the salesmen and mechanics on the frontlines of the boom, summer can be a grueling time. Sundresh Nambiar has worked in the business for eight years, though he bought his first AC just this summer. (Like Vora, it was out of concern for his parents’ health.) His shop, and the two that sit next to his beneath a pizza place by the side of a busy road, is typical of many in Ahmedabad: a narrow room, fluorescent lit, its walls entirely covered with AC units. </p>


<p id="9EDuqm">As the temperature climbs, Nambiar’s days grow longer, starting at 7:30AM and stretching past midnight. Customers get irate if their ACs can’t be installed immediately, and sometimes they try to bribe their way to the front of the line. Nambiar proudly said it’s first come, first served, except in cases of medical emergencies. The heat that’s driving sales is brutal to work in: Nambiar’s mechanics drench their clothes in water and spray down their tools to avoid searing their hands. It’s happened to Nambiar before.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="kFgsiY"><q>Mechanics spray down their tools to avoid searing their hands</q></aside></div>


<p id="UaoskU">Temperatures in Ahmedabad sometimes get so high that older ACs stop functioning, and repairmen like Dinesh Sata have found a lucrative business in keeping them running. “Because of climate change, machines break with overheating,” he said. Five years ago, it was just him and a couple employees. Now he has a staff of 14 and runs them like a fire department, dispatching teams of two as calls come in. In the summer, they work from 7:30 in the morning to 3AM, each duo taking as many as 20 calls a day. They move through the city on mopeds, so as to better weave through Ahmedabad’s snarled traffic. The repairmen, Sata said, “don’t even have time for food — just small snacks.” </p>


<p id="ZmiW98">Access to cooling falls along class lines, and Sata can read the affluence of a neighborhood by its air conditioners: older, probably secondhand units on one end, brands like Samsung and LG in the middle, and Mitsubishi and General at the top. </p>


<p id="hxbggP">The houses of the very wealthiest are lavishly cooled. “I installed one in a kitchen,” Sata said, incredulously. “And in the toilet.” The house, an old mansion owned by diamond dealers, had 29 ACs in total. Most people, of course, have none at all. “The poorer people,” he said, “they are suffering the most.”</p>


<p id="cSjV5L">Sata himself has no AC, but by choice. His work entails spending long hours in scorching heat, and he’s seen how dependent people become on ACs once they’re exposed to them. “If I get used to AC, I won’t be able to work.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="R2yyoY"><q>Sata can read the affluence of a neighborhood by its air conditioners</q></aside></div>


<p id="C47gYf">All the new ACs set to be installed from India to Brazil have added urgency to the race to make them less damaging to the climate. Last year in Kigali, Rwanda, negotiators from 197 countries amended the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fnations-agree-to-ban-refrigerants-that-worsen-climate-change-1.20810" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Montreal Protocol</a> to phase down use of the most potent greenhouse gas refrigerants, a measure that’s projected to avoid almost a degree of warming by 2100. India has until 2028 to start its reductions, but several companies active there have already begun switching to less-damaging chemicals. </p>


<p id="fMg00U">Meanwhile, India has begun programs meant to reduce the tremendous energy demand the AC boom will bring. It has a five-star rating system meant to encourage people to purchase more efficient ACs, and the shops in Ahmedabad display the stars with large stickers on each device. Several companies have released lines of 5.8-star ACs. Godrej, a New Delhi-based company, uses climate-friendly, though flammable, propane as a refrigerant; it boasts it’s broken the scale with a six-star AC. In order to drive down the price for consumers, earlier this summer, <a href="http://www.igsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Updated-EESL-AC-Bulk-Procurement-4-Aug.pdf">the Indian government arranged the bulk purchase</a> of 100,000 superefficient ACs from Panasonic and Godrej, and is planning to order half a million more.</p>


<p id="XD4Cvv">Even with increasing efficiency and better refrigerants, however, the energy demand will still be immense. The ACs India alone is expected to install by 2030 will be the equivalent of adding several new midsize countries to the global grid. With air conditioners already accounting for up to 60 percent of the summertime electricity use in cities like New Delhi, simply meeting the demand — and meeting it without burning huge amounts of fossil fuels — will be a challenge. “This AC load should be kind of taken with the same level of seriousness as renewable energy policies are taken,” said Nikit Abhyankar, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, pointing out that even <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/accelerating-energy-efficiency">incremental improvements</a> in efficiency will greatly reduce energy use.</p>


<p id="P9w0NS">In Ahmedabad, health officials worry that all the new ACs are pumping heat out into the streets, raising the temperature for anyone who can’t afford an AC of their own. If air conditioners become the only way of dealing with rising temperatures, the same dynamic risks playing out on a global scale. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="INQxia">In late July, on the leafy campus of Ahmedabad’s CEPT University, Professor Rajan Rawal stood outside his lab, drinking chai with his students, sheltering from a monsoon rain that was flooding the city. Tall, with short gray hair and dark mustache, he speaks with patrician weariness about the folly of the world of cooling.  </p>


<p id="S78Qw8">Refrigerated cooling first caught on as a way to preserve food, then to control humidity in factories. Finally it was used to cool people, but, Rawal said, it’s a blunt instrument, and shouldn’t be the only one. “You can’t simply take one pill and cure everything, or just take a fighter jet and win a war. You need various kinds of weapons and various medicines, in same way you need various strategies for buildings.” </p>


<p id="OkUoZ3">Some examples lay strewn about his lab: a segment of brick wall on a wheeled rack, meant to study heat absorption; a model building surrounded by lights on arcing tracks, meant to observe shade as the sun’s position changes; in the basement, a climate-controlled chamber where students sometimes sit to test the effectiveness of various cooling technologies. </p>

<p id="uXsW0g">The proliferation of air conditioning enabled building designs that were wholly dependent on air conditioning. Age-old cooling tricks like courtyards, crossbreeze-promoting corners, eaves, porches, and other architectural features were dispensed with. Developers, eager to capitalize on cheap designs and interior floor space that would’ve been stiflingly hot previously, turned to solid office blocks, glass towers, and boxy, mass-produced tract homes, relying on air conditioning to make them habitable. Air conditioning, writes Gail Cooper in <em>Air-Conditioning America</em>, “was the modern building’s iron lung.” </p>


<p id="nWACWq">As India urbanizes, the CEPT team sees an opportunity to take a different path when it comes to cooling, one with a smaller role for the air conditioner. “Do we go the route of the US and Western countries, not worry about efficiency, just whatever provides the cooling?” Yash Shukla, another researcher in Rawal’s program, asked me. “The climate impact of that is significant. If we can find a better approach to have the same level of comfort, why not do it the better way?”</p>

<p id="Qlc9IF">Their research took them somewhere esoteric: thermal comfort standards. When figuring out what sort of HVAC equipment to put in a building, engineers use models that attempt to predict what temperature and humidity levels occupants will be happy with. It’s a necessarily difficult attempt to quantify something subjective. One of the widest-used thermal comfort standards, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 55, acknowledges thermal comfort is “a condition of mind” before setting out on a valiant effort to model everything from the metabolic rate of someone typing to the insulation factor of calf-length socks.<strong> </strong></p>


<p id="01kPFG">ASHRAE dictates a comfortable temperature in the range of 67 to 82 degrees, depending on the season and other variables, yet it’s become a widely acknowledged problem that air-conditioned buildings are too cold. Figuring out exactly why — whether the standard is resulting in overpowered AC systems, building managers are overcooling so men can wear suits in summer, or some other reason — is “the holy grail,” in the words of one researcher, and the subject of ongoing research. </p>


<p id="lR9Vlp">There are big gains to be had in raising building temperatures. In 2005, Japan launched an energy-saving initiative called <a href="http://www.eesi.org/articles/view/the-japanese-cool-biz-campaign-increasing-comfort-in-the-workplace">Cool Biz</a>, setting office thermostats at 82 and encouraging workers to forgo ties and heavy business suits. After the 2011 nuclear meltdown, the program became Super Cool Biz: jackets came off, and polos, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121020142458/http://www.challenge25.go.jp/practice/coolbiz/coolbiz2012/fashion/">aloha shirts</a> were encouraged. If you needed sartorial guidance, <a href="http://www.fastretailing.com/eng/group/news/1205151500.html">Uniqlo</a> published recommendations, and the Environment Ministry sponsored a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alamy.com%2Fstock-photo-june-1-2012-tokyo-japan-a-models-sports-dress-down-casual-ware-during-40645450.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">fashion show</a> where men demonstrated how to pull off a blazer with shorts. <a href="https://ondankataisaku.env.go.jp/funtoshare/action/coolbiz/result_2010.html">By 2010</a>, the latest year for which data is available, Japan estimated that the program cut as much CO2 as almost 4 million households would emit in a month. </p>


<p id="zwDBSj">The CEPT researchers felt India’s standards needed revising, too. Most of the international comfort standards were developed by institutions in the global north, based largely on surveys of people unaccustomed to India’s heat. “The premise was that occupants in buildings in India are very different from occupants in Europe or the US, which is where the international standards come from,” said Sanyogita Manu, who led the study. “We didn’t have a thermal comfort model of our own.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="7CcV8h"><q>“We didn’t have a thermal comfort model of our own.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="upBiYP">Manu traveled to office buildings from humid Chennai in southern India to mountainous Shimla in the Himalayan foothills, wielding monitors to test the temperature, humidity, and airspeed, and asking workers whether they were comfortable. </p>


<p id="1k0Mqw">She <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315302171">found that</a> Indians are indeed comfortable at slightly higher temperatures than existing models would predict, particularly when in buildings that aren’t sealed up and air conditioned. Previous research has shown that in buildings without AC, people are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures the hotter it is outside; they don’t expect refrigerated coolness, they wear lighter clothes, they open windows, they use fans, and their bodies adjust to the heat. The mere feeling of control over things like windows and fans also makes people feel more comfortable, even if the temperature remains the same. The models that reflect this are called “adaptive,” but they’re typically only used for buildings that aren’t air conditioned at all. The CEPT team found that the same phenomenon also applied to mixed-mode buildings — buildings that switch on the AC when it gets hot — and that people were comfortable in environments up to almost 88 degrees. <a href="http://www.carbse.org/event/carbse-cept-thermal-comfort-research-included-in-national-building-code-2016/">Last year</a>, the Indian government adopted their model in the national building code. It’s expected to reduce energy spent to cool a building by a third. </p>

<p class="caption"><em>Cooling equipment beneath CEPT’s laboratory.</em></p>
</div></div>


<p id="lSGZig">The expanded threshold opens up new options for cooling. As we walked through the CEPT lab, Rawal pointed out the ceiling tiles: pipes of cold water run through them, emanating cool air downward on the researchers below. Ceiling fans stirred the air, and tower fans were scattered about, available for anyone dissatisfied with the office climate. Clamped to each researcher’s desk was a monitor, testing the temperature, humidity, and airspeed. Nestled in the trees of the campus, positioned to minimize direct sun exposure, and equipped with a suite of various cooling technologies, the building is able to coast without air conditioning until the heat gets extreme. With solar panels on the roof, the building produces more energy than it uses over the course of the year. The air inside felt slightly damp, but cool. </p>


<p id="hc7IAM">Rawal and his team say buildings like this are the way forward for India, but they’re well aware of the challenges to widespread adoption. Buildings like CEPT’s require bespoke design, whereas air-conditioned buildings can be mass-produced and are cheap to make, if not to keep cool. “You get a bad building, you still buy it because a split AC can make it habitable,” Rawal said. “Hence people are making it because they know you’ll find a way to make it habitable.” </p>


<p id="K9LNvI">Rawal is particularly intrigued by one technology in particular: the evaporative cooler. It uses far less electricity than an air conditioner, and doesn’t use refrigerants. Instead, a fan blows on a wetted pad, cooling hot air through evaporation. Also known as an air cooler or swamp cooler, it’s an electric version of the drenched sheets Vora’s parents used. One such machine sits in the lab’s thermal comfort chamber, amid fans and thermometers and a sensor-filled manikin dressed in a beige kurti, sitting at a desk. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="bLtKph">The world’s largest cooler manufacturer, Symphony, is based in Ahmedabad, in a conspicuously modern concrete building sitting amid trees and empty lots off the highway. Founded in 1988, the company is now worth over a billion dollars and has made its founder and chairman, Achal Bakeri, one of the country’s <a href="http://www.forbesindia.com/printcontent/41353">richest people</a>. </p>


<p id="rVUQ9o">Bakeri, the scion of a prominent real estate family, offers a classic startup origin story for the company’s founding. Home after completing an MBA at the University of Southern California, he was sitting in his parents’ living room when he was struck by the ugliness of their air cooler. “It worked really well, but the product was aesthetically very bad and made a lot of noise,” he said. He took it apart and started learning how it worked. Seeing an opportunity, he put a small team together to design a better version. They set up shop in the parking garage of one of his family’s construction sites and built the first Symphony air cooler. Their first run sold out within a week. </p>


<p id="cuGJpv">Today, the company is focused on air coolers and air coolers only, and it’s expanding into markets abroad — markets that climate change is helping open. In 2010, Russia was hit by an <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/2010-russian-heatwave-more-extreme-than-previously-thought">unprecedented and deadly</a> heat wave, with temperatures in Moscow passing 100 degrees. Soon after, Symphony began getting inquiries from dealers in Russia interested in carrying their products. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Bd05UI"><q>“Not even in our wildest of dreams did we consider that a market.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="TE8UX1">“Not even in our wildest of dreams did we consider that a market,” said Rajesh Mishra, vice president of sales. “But we realized that heat is relative. In Russia, the moment it touches 35 [95 Fahrenheit] people just go crazy. Four or five years back, temperatures in the UK touched about 27 [80.6 Fahrenheit]  and everybody jumped into the lake,” he said, laughing. (He sets his AC to 80 Fahrenheit.) “There were photographs of people stripping off their shirts, jumping in fountains.” Now the UK is buying Symphony coolers, too. </p>


<p id="2LgBHU">Mishra sees a unique opportunity for Symphony in the extreme and unpredictable heat waves brought on by climate change. Coolers are cheap and use little power, making them affordable to many for whom ACs are out of reach. They’re also relatively easy to set up — you just need to fill them with water and plug them in. In a generally temperate place like Germany, it wouldn't be worth the hassle and expense of installing an AC, Mishra said, but a cooler would be easy to roll out of the closet in the event of a freak heat wave. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><div id="KpRTOL"><div></div></div></div>


<p id="DbqTrZ">The major drawback of coolers is that they don’t work when it’s humid, for the same reason sweating loses its effectiveness. If the air is nearly saturated with moisture already, water won’t evaporate off the pad, the air won’t cool, and the device will function more like fan that makes the room even muggier. But in hot and dry regions, they work very well. In addition to India, Symphony’s core markets are arid countries in the Middle East and Africa. In 2009, they scooped up IMPCO, a Phoenix-based company that has been producing coolers since the 1930s. Its manufacturing facilities in Mexico have opened up new markets in Latin America, and eventually perhaps the American Southwest. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="MpXcHU"><q>Symphony’s biggest project so far — the biggest air cooler project anywhere so far — is Mecca</q></aside></div>


<p id="5ny6VB">Coolers can also do something air conditioners can’t: because they lower the temperature of the air that passes through them, rather than removing heat from a sealed room, they can cool people in huge open spaces and even outdoors. Symphony’s biggest project so far — the biggest air cooler project <em>anywhere</em> so far — is Mecca. In 2006, Symphony installed 200 giant coolers on the Jamarat Bridge, which millions of pilgrims cross each year, and 50,000 units in the residential section, where cooler intakes jut up from each tent like chimneys. </p>


<p id="DiS4Yr">Cavernous factories, warehouses, outdoor restaurants, and amusement parks will be growing markets for coolers, Mishra said, especially as temperatures rise. In 2015, Symphony bought the Chinese cooler company Keruilai, and is now cooling automobile factories and train maintenance yards there. “As the temperature goes up, working conditions will become harsher in factories,” Mishra said. “The demand for air coolers will be enormous.” </p>


<p id="sa2IlJ">Mishra recognizes climate change as a threat, and a business opportunity. “It looks bright!” he said, laughing, when I asked him about the future of the cooling industry. “Because of the changing climate, unfortunately. This is an irreversible process, and now with the great Mr. Donald Trump pulling out of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15718660/donald-trump-paris-climate-change-agreement-us-pulls-out">treaty</a>, things will become even worse,” he said, smiling grimly.</p>

<p id="VOGuYu">During the summer of 2010, Tejas Shah, a deputy health officer with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, noticed a strange increase in deaths. “Between the 19th of May and 23rd, the number of deaths each day were somewhere around 300, which is three times the normal,” Shah said, sitting at a desk strewn with folders and maps of his jurisdiction. The city first suspected there was an unknown epidemic, but found no outbreaks. Then they checked the temperature. “In these four or five days, the temperature was beyond 45 [113 Fahrenheit]. There was no other obvious reason.” </p>


<p id="ye8Ni8">Despite being among the deadliest natural disasters, heat waves often escape notice. They’re largely invisible when they happen, and leave no wrecked buildings behind. They frequently kill indirectly, by fatally stressing existing health conditions, so their full toll is only evident much later, statistically. And they kill the most vulnerable and overlooked: the elderly or already sick; the socially isolated, who have no one to check in on them; and the working poor, who have to risk laboring in the heat or go without food. </p>

<p id="xtOOKW">After the 2010 heat wave became apparent, Ahmedabad began formulating a plan for coping with extreme temperatures. Working with the Natural Resource Defense Council, Georgia Tech, and other institutions, Ahmedabad developed an early-warning system and a strategy for mobilizing the city in advance of impending heat waves. Shah is now the coordinating heat officer for the city of five and a half million, in addition to other emergency management duties that result in an unending barrage of calls, texts, and knocks at the door, which he greets with wry forbearance. </p>


<p id="phodQO">When extreme heat is forecast, Shah sends out WhatsApp alerts to health officers, hospital liaisons, the fire department, the police, the parks department, and other officials. Color-coded heat warnings are announced in newspapers, on television, and through social media. Phone companies send out SMS warnings. Social workers go into slums, where these warnings might not reach, and hand out rehydration packets and pamphlets on heat safety. Hospitals prepare ice packs and heat wards, water stations are set up on street corners, and temples, mosques, and malls double as cooling centers. It’s proven effective: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/06/10/indias-hellish-heat-wave-in-hindsight/">in 2015</a>, when heat waves killed over 2,500 people across India, Ahmedabad <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ahmedabad-heat-action-plan-2016.pdf">reported fewer than 20</a> heat-related deaths. The model is now being copied by Nagpur, Gondia, and 15 other Indian cities.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="1lvvAa"><q>“If it remains for a month? It would be a natural disaster.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="nxO9pz">But rising temperatures will strain the system the city has put in place. While hospitals in Ahmedabad have been building out heat wards, they would run out of space if a heat wave stuck around for long. And while members of the growing air-conditioned class can shelter in cooled offices and homes, the poor must go out to work on construction sites, build roads, and sell wares on baking streets. </p>


<p id="aAd9Yd">“Suppose for a day or two or three the temperature is between 47 and 48 [116–118 Fahrenheit],” said Bhavin Solanki, Ahmedabad’s chief health officer. “We can control the situation. But if it remains for a month?” he said, pausing. “It would be a natural disaster.” </p>


<p id="E6fWx5">The scale of what cities will need to do to truly adapt to the heat is daunting. Simply waiting for people to get cooling appliances isn’t enough — too many would be left behind. Public health programs like Ahmedabad’s save many lives, but as temperatures rise, more drastic measures will be needed.</p>

<p id="FWQXZp">The climate researcher Vimal Mishra, who teaches in nearby Gandhinagar, described India’s situation as a race against temperature. He ran through some of the measures needed to beat the heat; as the list grew, it gradually took on the feel of science fiction. People will have to run air conditioners constantly, and new energy sources will have to be built to power them. There will have to be air-conditioned transit because people won’t be able to bike in the sweltering streets. Working hours will have to be shifted to avoid the hottest parts of the day. New buildings will have to be designed that can stay cool with less energy. Maybe, he said, those buildings will have to be prefabricated in cooled warehouses to minimize time spent outdoors. Maybe workers will have to wear personal cooling gear, like the solar-powered cooling hardhats <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-qatar-worldcup-helmet-idUKKBN14I137">Qatar is experimenting</a> with. Heat kills animals, too, so livestock will have to be brought inside and cooled.  </p>


<p id="YUnCFl">This is the good scenario, one where carbon emissions are curtailed. The other, where temperatures pass the threshold of human survivability, would entail mass migration, or as Jonathan Buzan, a researcher who works with Mishra put it, fantastical infrastructure projects, citing the Isaac Asimov novel <em>The</em> <em>Caves of Steel</em>, where humanity shelters in climate-controlled domes.<strong> </strong>It’s a tug-of-war, Mishra said, between rising temperatures and our ability to adapt. “Who, will win? Probably, I would go for humans,” he said, optimistic but hedging. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="ybDizi"><q> “Who, will win? Probably, I would go for humans.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="F8udE5">Adapting will be expensive. With every degree of warming that gets locked into the climate system, the more it will cost to maintain something resembling normal life, and the more people there will be who are unable to afford it. The particular problem posed by heat isn’t that it’s impossible to adapt to, it’s that it’s difficult to adapt to equitably and in a way that doesn’t make the problem worse. Like mitigating climate change overall, any cooling solution will require collective action, in the form of international agreements like the Kigali Amendment, efficiency regulations, subsidies, technological advances, new building designs, and civic programs. </p>


<p id="m4fqFM">This year, Ahmedabad added an element to its heat action plan designed not just to cope with extreme heat, but reduce it. A quarter of the city’s population lives in the slums ringing the city, jammed together in small concrete boxes with tin roofs that turn them into solar ovens. The city has begun <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/nehmat-kaur/ahmedabad-cool-roofs-initiative-5th-heat-action-plan">painting these roofs white</a>, and covering public buildings with reflective white mosaic tiles. It’s a modest adaptation, but it can drop the indoor temperature by several degrees. “The fact is that the gap between the rich people and the poor people is increasing,” Shah said. “It is going to be very difficult. They are going to be more vulnerable, they are going to face more problems.”</p>


<p id="YIAB9E">Shah has his own list of immediate adaptations the city needs to make. More trees need to be planted, he said, to lower the city’s temperature. There need to be more cooling centers installed, and mass transit should be expanded so all the internal combustion engines stop heating the streets. There will need to be new regulations around working hours for jobs like construction, so laborers don’t die of heatstroke. The city is looking for ways to build awnings that can shade whole intersections, so vendors and traffic police can get shelter from the sun. Piece by mundane piece, through new appliances and public works, the city will have to reconfigure itself to survive in the changing climate. </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="XmPgTV">“It’s going to be hotter,” Shah said. “It’s not getting cooler anymore.” </p>

<p id="Bb8QmL"><em>This month marks 10 years since Apple launched the first iPhone, a device that would fundamentally transform how we interact with technology, culture, and each other. Ahead of that anniversary, </em>Motherboard<em> editor Brian Merchant embarked on an investigation to uncover the iPhone’s untold origin. </em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01LWRN0KI%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The One Device: The secret history of the iPhone</a>,<em> out on June 20th, traces that journey from Kenyan mines to Chinese factories all the way to One Infinite Loop. The following excerpt has been lightly condensed and edit</em><em>ed</em><em>.</em></p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CEqfhz">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UGTtF0">If you worked at Apple in the mid-2000s, you might have noticed a strange phenomenon afoot: people were disappearing. </p>


<p id="Ugn2WI">It happened slowly at first. One day there’d be an empty chair where a star engineer used to sit. A key member of the team, gone. Nobody could tell you exactly where they went. </p>


<p id="hRe19B">“I had been hearing rumblings about, well, it was unclear what was being built, but it was clear that a lot of the best engineers from the best teams had been slurped over to this mysterious team,” says Evan Doll, who was then a software engineer at Apple. </p>


<p id="QF15Ko">Here’s what was happening to those star engineers. First, a couple of managers had shown up in their office unannounced and closed the door behind them. Managers like Henri Lamiraux, a director of software engineering, and Richard Williamson, a director of software. </p>


<p id="B4AEDM">One such star engineer was Andre Boule. He’d been at the company only a few months. </p>


<p id="QKws4I">“Henri and I walked into his office,” Williamson recalls, “and we said, ‘Andre, you don’t really know us, but we’ve heard a lot about you, and we know you’re a brilliant engineer, and we want you to come work with us on a project we can’t tell you about. And we want you to do it now. Today.’ ” </p>


<p id="6mkKac">Boule was incredulous, then suspicious. “Andre said, ‘Can I have some time to think about it?’ ” Williamson says. “And we said, ‘No.’ ” They wouldn’t, and couldn’t, give him any more details. Still, by the end of the day, Boule had signed on. “We did that again and again across the company,” Williamson says. Some engineers who liked their jobs just fine said no, and they stayed in Cupertino. Those who said yes, like Boule, went to work on the iPhone. </p>


<p id="Ha8gf2">And their lives would never be the same — at least, not for the next two and a half years. Not only would they be working overtime to hammer together the most influential piece of consumer technology of their generation, but they’d be doing little else. Their personal lives would disappear, and they wouldn’t be able to talk about what they were working on. Steve Jobs “didn’t want anyone to leak it if they left the company,” says Tony Fadell, one of the top Apple executives who helped build the iPhone. “He didn’t want anyone to say anything. He just didn’t want — he was just naturally paranoid.” </p>

<p id="7kJIEz">Jobs told Scott Forstall, who would become the head of the iPhone software division, that even he couldn’t breathe a word about the phone to anyone, inside Apple or out, who wasn’t on the team. “He didn’t want, for secrecy reasons, for me to hire anyone outside of Apple to work on the user interface,” Forstall said. “But he told me I could move anyone in the company into this team.” So he dispatched managers like Henri and Richard to find the best candidates. And he made sure potential recruits knew the stakes upfront. “We’re starting a new project,” he told them. “It’s so secret, I can’t even tell you what that new project is. I cannot tell you who you will work for. What I can tell you is if you choose to accept this role, you’re going to work harder than you ever have in your entire life. You’re going to have to give up nights and weekends probably for a couple years as we make this product.” </p>


<p id="wn5JTB">And “amazingly,” as Forstall put it, some of the top talent at the company signed on. “Honestly, everyone there was brilliant,” Williamson tells me. That team — veteran designers, rising programmers, managers who’d worked with Jobs for years, engineers who’d never met him — would end up becoming one of the great, unheralded creative forces of the twenty-first century. </p>


<p id="Kqgx5B">One of Apple’s greatest strengths is that it makes its technology look and feel easy to use. There was nothing easy about making the iPhone, though its inventors say the process was often exhilarating. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="F6h1GK"><q>“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="zxyU93">Forstall’s prediction to the iPhone team would be borne out. </p>


<p id="z0dyvc">“The iPhone is the reason I’m divorced,” Andy Grignon, a senior iPhone engineer, tells me. I heard that sentiment more than once throughout my dozens of interviews with the iPhone’s key architects and engineers. “Yeah, the iPhone ruined more than a few marriages,” says another. </p>


<p id="uWeb3F">“It was really intense, probably professionally one of the worst times of my life,” Grignon says. “Because you created a pressure cooker of a bunch of really smart people with an impossible deadline, an impossible mission, and then you hear that the future of the entire company is resting on it. So it was just like this soup of misery,” Grignon says. “There wasn’t really time to kick your feet back on the desk and say, ‘This is going to be really fucking awesome one day.’ It was like, ‘Holy fuck, we’re fucked.’ Every time you turned around there was some just imminent demise of the program just lurking around the corner.” </p>


<h1 id="YZQG7n"><strong>Making the iPhone </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="YaXYDp">The iPhone began as a Steve Jobs–approved project at Apple around the end of 2004. But its DNA began coiling long before that. </p>


<p id="llqibo">“I think a lot of people look at the form factor and they think it’s not just like any other computer, but it is — it’s just like any other computer,” Williamson says. “In fact, it’s <em>more</em> complex, in terms of software, than many other computers. The operating system on this is as sophisticated as the operating system on any modern computer. But it is an evolution of the operating system we’ve been developing over the last thirty years.”</p>

<p id="FZlsX8">Like many mass-adopted, highly profitable technologies, the iPhone has a number of competing origin stories. There were as many as five different phone or phone-related projects — from tiny research endeavors to full-blown corporate partnerships — bubbling up at Apple by the middle of the 2000s. But if there’s anything I’ve learned in my efforts to pull the iPhone apart, literally and figuratively, it’s that there are rarely concrete beginnings to any particular products or technologies — they evolve from varying previous ideas and concepts and inventions and are prodded and iterated into newness by restless minds and profit motives. Even when the company’s executives were under oath in a federal trial, they couldn’t name just one starting place. </p>


<p id="QXHMvC">“There were many things that led to the development of the iPhone at Apple,” Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said in 2012. “First, Apple had been known for years for being the creator of the Mac, the computer, and it was great, but it had small market share,” he said. “And then we had a big hit called the iPod. It was the iPod hardware and the iTunes software. And this really changed everybody’s view of Apple, both inside and outside the company. And people started asking, Well, if you can have a big hit with the iPod, what else can you do? And people were suggesting every idea, make a camera, make a car, crazy stuff.” </p>


<p id="nQIWmr">And make a phone, of course. </p>


<h1 id="lzH8nA"><strong>Open the Pod Bay Doors </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="2eA8op">When Steve Jobs returned to take the helm of a flailing Apple in 1997, he garnered acclaim and earned a slim profit by slashing product lines and getting the Mac business back on track. But Apple didn’t reemerge as a major cultural and economic force until it released the iPod, which would mark its first profitable entry into consumer electronics and become a blueprint and a springboard for the iPhone in the process. </p>


<p id="3KNnl3">“There would be no iPhone without the iPod,” says Tony Fadell, who helped build both of them. Fadell, sometimes dubbed “the Podfather” by the media, was a driving force in creating Apple’s first bona fide hit device in years, and he’d oversee hardware development for the iPhone. As such, there are few better people to explain the bridge between the two hit devices. We met at Brasserie Thoumieux, a swank eatery in Paris’s gilded seventh arrondissement, where he was living at the time. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="G6xZdo"><q>He’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="67VoNm">Fadell is a looming figure in modern Silicon Valley lore, and he’s divisive in the annals of Apple. Brian Huppi and Joshua Strickon, key members of Apple’s input engineering team, who’d prototyped the earliest drafts of the iPhone, praise him for his audacious, get-it-done management style (“Don’t take longer than a year to ship a product” is one of his credos) and for being one of the few people strong enough of will to stand up to Steve Jobs. Others chafe at the credit he takes for his role in bringing the iPod and iPhone to market; he’s been called “Tony Baloney,” and one former Apple exec advised me “not to believe a single word Tony Fadell says.” After he left Apple in 2008, he co-founded Nest, a company that crafted smart home gadgets, like learning thermostats, which was later acquired by Google for $3.2 billion. </p>


<p id="iHB9NT">Right on time, Fadell strode in; shaved head save for some stubble, icy blue eyes, snug sweater. He was once renowned for his cyberpunk style, his rebellious streak, and a fiery temper that was often compared to Jobs’s. Fadell is still undeniably intense, but here, speaking easy French to the waitstaff, he was smack in the overlap of a Venn diagram showing Mannered Parisian Elite and Brash Tech Titan. </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tmIJt9">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="450WOo">“The genesis of the iPhone, was — well, let’s get started with — was iPod dominance,” Fadell says. “It was fifty percent of Apple’s revenue.” But when iPods initially shipped in 2001, hardly anyone noticed them. “It took two years,” Fadell says. “It was only made for the Mac. It was less than one percent market share in the U.S. They like to say ‘low single digits.’ ” Consumers needed iTunes software to load and manage the songs and playlists, and that software ran only on Macs. </p>


<p id="jYRZEA">“Over my dead body are you gonna ship iTunes on a PC,” Steve Jobs told Fadell, he says, when Fadell pushed the idea of offering iTunes on Windows. Nonetheless, Fadell had a team secretly building out the software to make iTunes compatible with Windows. “It took two years of failing numbers before Steve finally woke up. Then we started to take off, then the music store was able to be a success.” That success put iPods in the hands of hundreds of millions of people— more than had ever owned Macs. Moreover, the iPod was hip in a fashionably mainstream way that lent a patina of cool to Apple as a whole. Fadell rose in the executive ranks and oversaw the new product division. </p>


<p id="ozNw5l">Launched in 2001, a hit by 2003, the iPod was deemed vulnerable as early as 2004. The mobile phone was seen as a threat because it could play MP3s. “So if you could only carry one device, which one would you have to choose?” Fadell says. “And that’s why the Motorola Rokr happened.” </p>


<h1 id="4nwGV7"><strong>Rokring Out </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="prGx7F">In 2004, Motorola was manufacturing one of the most popular phones on the market, the ultrathin Razr flip phone. Its new CEO, Ed Zander, was friendly with Jobs, who liked the Razr’s design, and the two set about exploring how Apple and Motorola might collaborate. (In 2003, Apple execs had considered buying Motorola outright but decided it’d be too expensive.) Thus the “iTunes phone” was born. Apple and Motorola partnered with the wireless carrier Cingular, and the Rokr was announced that summer. </p>


<p id="UOpVAG">Publicly, Jobs had been resistant to the idea of Apple making a phone. “The problem with a phone,” Steve Jobs said in 2005, “is that we’re not very good going through orifices to get to the end users.” By <em>orifices</em>, he meant carriers like Verizon and AT&amp;T, which had final say over which phones could access their networks. “Carriers now have gained the upper hand in terms of the power of the relationship with the handset manufacturers,” he continued. “So the handset manufacturers are really getting these big thick books from the carriers telling them here’s what your phone’s going to be. We’re not good at that.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="EBCgzx"><q>Jobs “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd.’” </q></aside></div>


<p id="i0Dfgp">Privately, Jobs had other reservations. One former Apple executive who had daily meetings with Jobs told me that the carrier issue wasn’t his biggest hang-up. He was concerned with a lack of focus in the company, and he “wasn’t convinced that smartphones were going to be for anyone but the ‘pocket protector crowd,’ as we used to call them.” </p>


<p id="1T3MQw">Partnering with Motorola was an easy way to try to neutralize a threat to the iPod. Motorola would make the handset; Apple would do the iTunes software. “It was, How can we make it a very small experience, so they still had to buy an iPod? Give them a taste of iTunes and basically turn it into an iPod Shuffle so that they’ll want to upgrade to an iPod. That was the initial strategy,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Let’s not cannibalize the iPod because it’s going so well.’ ” </p>


<div id="BTFzkJ"><div></div></div>


<p id="BuZLVX">As soon as the collaboration was made public, Apple’s voracious rumor mill started churning. With an iTunes phone on the horizon, blogs began feeding the anticipation for a transformative mobile device that had been growing for some time already. </p>


<p id="V18ldG">Inside Apple, however, expectations for the Rokr could not have been lower. “We all knew how bad it was,” Fadell says. “They’re slow, they can’t get things to change, they’re going to limit the songs.” Fadell laughs aloud when discussing the Rokr today. “All of these things were coming together to make sure it was really a shitty experience.” </p>


<p id="gNi2Wa">But there may have been another reason that Apple’s executives were tolerating the Rokr’s unfurling shittiness. “Steve was gathering information during those meetings” with Motorola and Cingular, Richard Williamson says. He was trying to figure out how he might pursue a deal that would let Apple retain control over the design of its phone. He considered having Apple buy its own bandwidth and become its own mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO. Apple approached Verizon, but the two companies were unable to ink a deal; telecoms still wanted too much control over how a handset was designed. An executive at Cingular, meanwhile, began to cobble together an alternative deal Jobs might actually embrace: <em>Give Cingular exclusivity, and we’ll give you complete freedom over the device</em>. </p>


<h1 id="RmmhtJ"><strong>Fix What You Hate </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="mXjbik">From Steve Jobs to Jony Ive to Tony Fadell to Apple’s engineers, designers, and managers, there’s one part of the iPhone mythology that everyone tends to agree on: Before the iPhone, everyone at Apple thought cell phones “sucked.” They were “terrible.” Just “pieces of junk.” We’ve already seen how Jobs felt about phones that dropped calls. </p>


<p id="X2Hoaf">“Apple is best when it’s fixing the things that people hate,” Greg Christie, who was head of Apple’s Human Interface Group at the time, tells me. Before the iPod, nobody could figure out how to use a digital music player; as Napster boomed, people took to carting around skip-happy portable CD players loaded with burned albums. And before the Apple II, computers were mostly considered too complex and unwieldy for the layperson. </p>


<p id="yiHN0i">“For at least a year before starting on what would become the iPhone project, even internally at Apple, we were grumbling about how all of these phones out there were all terrible,” says Nitin Ganatra, who managed Apple’s email team before working on the iPhone. It was water-cooler talk. But it reflected a growing sense inside the company that since Apple had successfully fixed — transformed, then dominated — one major product category, it could do the same with another. </p>


<p id="Re3CSK">“At the time,” Ganatra says, “it was like, ‘Oh my God, we need to go in and clean up this market too — why isn’t Apple making a phone?’ ” </p>


<h1 id="pQygSc">
<strong>Calling All Pods</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="f4uxKW">Andy Grignon was restless. The versatile engineer had been at Apple for a few years, working in different departments on various projects. He’s a gleefully imposing figure— shaved-head bald, cheerful, and built like a friendly bear. He had a hand in everything from creating the software that powered the iPod to working on the software for a videoconferencing program and iChat. He’d become friends with rising star Tony Fadell when they’d built the iSight camera together. </p>


<p id="C3mU2Y">After wrapping up another major project — writing the Mac feature Dashboard, which Grignon affectionately calls “his baby” (it’s the widget-filled screen with the calculator and the calendar and so on) — he was looking for something fresh to do. “Fadell reached out and said, ‘Do you want to come join iPod? We’ve got some really cool shit. I’ve got this other project I really want to do but we need some time before we can convince Steve to do it, and I think you’d be great for it.’” </p>


<p id="17F8cL">Grignon is boisterous and hardworking. He’s also got a mouth like a Silicon Valley sailor. “So I left,” Grignon says, “to work on this mystery thing. So we just kind of spun our wheels on some wireless speakers and shit like that, but then the project started to materialize. Of course what Fadell was talking about was the phone.” Fadell knew Jobs was beginning to come around to the idea, and he wanted to be prepared. “We had this idea: Wouldn’t it be great to put WiFi in an iPod?” Grignon says. Throughout 2004, Fadell, Grignon, and the rest of the team worked on a number of early efforts to fuse iPod and internet communicator. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="mJl7Sm"><q>It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’” </q></aside></div>


<p id="PScVYu">“That was one of the very first prototypes I showed Steve. We gutted an iPod, we had hardware add in a WiFi part, so it was a big plastic piece of junk, and we modified the software.” There were click-wheel iPods that could clumsily surf the web as early as 2004. “You would click the wheel, you would scroll the web page, and if there was a link on the page, it would highlight it, and you could click on it and you could jump in,” Grignon says. “That was the very first time where we started experimenting with radios in the form factor.” </p>


<p id="73VLAt">It was also the first time Steve Jobs had seen the internet running on an iPod. “And he was like, ‘This is bullshit.’ He called it right away… ‘I don’t want this. I know it works, I got it, great, thanks, but this is a shitty experience,’ ” Grignon says. </p>


<p id="qIof7q">Meanwhile, Grignon says, “The exec team was trying to convince Steve that building a phone was a great idea for Apple. He didn’t really see the path to success.” </p>


<p id="dUqHna">One of those trying to do the convincing was Mike Bell. A veteran of Apple, where he’d worked for fifteen years, and of Motorola’s wireless division, Bell was positive that computers, music players, and cell phones were heading toward an inevitable convergence point. For months, he lobbied Jobs to do a phone, as did Steve Sakoman, a vice president who had worked on the ill-fated Newton. </p>


<p id="R1avKg">“We were spending all this time putting iPod features in Motorola phones,” Bell says. “That just seemed ass-backwards to me. If we just took the iPod user experience and some of the other stuff we were working on, we could own the market.” It was getting harder to argue with that logic. The latest batches of MP3 phones were looking increasingly like iPod competitors, and new alternatives for dealing with the carriers were emerging. Meanwhile, Bell had seen Jony Ive’s latest iPod designs.</p>


<p id="drK79D">On November 7, 2004, Bell sent Jobs a late-night email. “Steve, I know you don’t want to do a phone,” he wrote, “but here’s why we should do it: Jony Ive has some really cool designs for future iPods that no one has seen. We ought to take one of those, put some Apple software around it, and make a phone out if ourselves instead of putting our stuff on other people’s phones.” </p>


<p id="3NTk7J">Jobs called him right away. They argued for hours, pushing back and forth. Bell detailed his convergence theory — no doubt mentioning the fact that the mobile phone market was exploding worldwide — and Jobs picked it apart. Finally, he relented. </p>


<p id="POLpVa">“Okay, I think we should go do it,” he said. </p>


<p id="5rqNQ5">“So Steve and I and Jony and Sakoman had lunch three or four days later and kicked off the iPhone project.” </p>


<h1 id="jQil50"><strong>Reviving the Apple Tablet </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="pH51ih">At 2 Infinite Loop, an older touchscreen-tablet research project was still chugging along. Bas Ording, Imran Chaudhri, and company were still exploring the contours of a basic touch-focused user interface.</p>


<p id="uDdZqH">One day, Bas Ording got a call from Steve. He said, “We’re gonna do a phone.” </p>


<p id="o4Dewr">Years ago, a handful of input engineers and key designers had prototyped multitouch-focused interaction demos, followed by the Q79 tablet project — an experimental early stab at an iPad-like device. But a tangle of obstacles, not least of which was that it was too expensive, shut it down. (“You’ve got to give me something I can sell,” he told Imran.) But with a smaller screen and scaled-down system, Q79 might work as a phone. </p>


<p id="je6L7A">“It’s gonna have a small screen, it’s gonna be just a touchscreen, there’s not gonna be any buttons, and everything has to work on that,” Jobs told Ording. He asked the UI wiz to make a demo of scrolling through a virtual address book with multitouch. “I was super-excited,” Ording says. “I thought, <em>Yeah, it seems kind of impossible, but it would be fun to just try it</em>.” He sat down, “moused off” a phone-size section of his Mac’s screen, and used it to model the iPhone surface. He and a scant few other designers had spent years experimenting with touch-based user interfaces — and those years in the touchscreen wilderness were paying off. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="9d3K55"><q>“When I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ”</q></aside></div>


<p id="x08Vdh">“We already had some other demos, a web page, for example — it was just a picture you could scroll with momentum,” Ording says. “That’s sort of how it started.” The famous effect where your screen bounces when you hit the top or bottom of a page was born because Ording couldn’t tell when he’d hit the top of a page. “I thought my program wasn’t running because I tried to scroll and nothing would happen,” he says, and then he’d realize he was scrolling in the wrong direction. “So that’s when I started to think, <em>How can I make it so you can see or feel that you’re at the end?</em> Right? Instead of feeling dead, like it’s not responding.” </p>


<p id="pFyn3W">These small details, which we now take for granted, were the product of exhaustive tinkering, of proof-of-concept experimenting. Like inertial scrolling, the wonky-sounding but now-universal effect that makes scrolling down your contact list feel satisfyingly tactile; the names fly by in a burst after you swipe down, then slow to a tick-tock as if bound by real-world physics</p>


<p id="t0pvdB">“I had to try all kinds of things and figure out some math,” Ording says. “Not all of it was complicated, but you have to get to the right combinations, and that’s the tricky thing. ” Eventually, Ording got it to feel natural.</p>


<p id="JJAuiA">“He called me back a few weeks later, and he had inertial scrolling working,” Jobs said. “And when I saw the rubber band, inertial scrolling, and a few of the other things, I thought, ‘My God, we can build a phone out of this.’ ” </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Y8HXgl">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="FaPRI7">Scott Forstall walked into Greg Christie’s office near the end of 2004 and gave him the news too: Jobs wanted to do a phone. He’d been waiting about a decade to hear those words. </p>


<p id="TxLnho">Christie is intense and brusque; his stocky build and sharp eyes feel loaded with kinetic energy. He joined Apple in the 1990s, when the company was in a downward spiral, just to work on the Newton— then one of the most promising mobile devices on the market. Then, he’d even tried to push Apple to do a Newton phone. “I’m sure I proposed it a dozen times,” Christie says. “The internet was popping too— this is going to be a big deal: mobile, internet, phone.” </p>


<p id="qwwfYV">Now, his Human Interface team — his knobs-and-dials crew — was about to embark on its most radical challenge yet. Its members gathered on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop, right above the old user-testing lab, and set to work expanding the features, functionality, and look of the old ENRI tablet project. The handful of designers and engineers set up shop in a drab office replete with stained carpet, old furniture, a leaky bathroom next door, and little on the walls but a whiteboard and, for some reason, a poster of a chicken. </p>


<p id="dk3fsB">Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes. The CEO was already imbuing the nascent iPhone project with top-to-bottom secrecy. “You know, the cleaning crews weren’t allowed in here because there were these sliding whiteboards along the wall,” Christie says. The team would sketch ideas on them, and the good ones stayed put. “We wouldn’t erase them. They became part of the design conversation.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="RS5bNz"><q>Jobs liked the room because it was secure, windowless, tucked away from straying eyes</q></aside></div>


<p id="15zJIt">That conversation was about how to blend a touch-based UI with smartphone features. </p>


<p id="6niJw1">Fortunately, they’d had a head start. There were the ENRI crew’s multitouch demos, of course. But Imran Chaudhri had also led the design for Dashboard, which was full of widgets — weather, stocks, calculator, notes, calendar — that would be ideal for the phone. “The early idea for the phone was all about having these widgets in your pocket,” Chaudhri says. So they ported them over. </p>


<p id="DNO1C6">The original design for many of those icons was actually created in a single night, back during the development of Dashboard. “It was one of those fucking crazy Steve deadlines,” Imran says, “where he wanted to see a demo of everything.” So he and Freddy Anzures, a recent hire to the HI team, spent a long night coming up with the rectilinear design concepts for the widgets — which would, years later, become the designs for the iPhone icons. “It’s funny, the look of smartphone icons for a decade to come was hashed out in a few hours.” </p>


<p id="c6IbtN">And they had to establish the fundamentals; for instance, What should it look like when you fire up your phone? A grid of apps seems like the obvious way to organize a smartphone’s functions today — now that it’s like water, as Chaudhri says — but it wasn’t a foregone conclusion. “We tried some other stuff,” Ording says. “Like, maybe it’s a list of icons with the names after them.” But what came to be called Springboard emerged early on as the standard. “They were little Chiclets, basically,” Ording says. “Now, that’s Imran too, that was a great idea, and it looked really nice.” </p>


<p id="34Magt">Chaudhri had the Industrial Design team make a few wooden iPhone-like mock-ups so they could figure out the optimal size of the icons for a finger’s touch. </p>


<p id="jLGMAE">The multitouch demos were promising, and the style was coming together. But what the team lacked was cohesion — a united idea of what a touch-based phone would be. </p>


<p id="f3Scow">“It was really just sketches,” Christie says. “Little fragments of ideas, like tapas. A little bit of this, a little of that. Could be part of Address Book, a slice of Safari.” Tapas wouldn’t sate Jobs, obviously; he wanted a full course. So he grew increasingly frustrated with the presentations. </p>


<p id="yUd9zE">“In January, in the New Year, he blows a gasket and tells us we’re not getting it,” Christie says. The fragments might have been impressive, but there was no narrative drawing the disparate parts together; it was a jumble of half-apps and ideas. There was no story. </p>


<p id="H4IgZm">“It was as if you delivered a story to your editor and it was a couple of sentences from the introductory paragraph, a few from the body, and then something from the middle of the conclusion — but not the concluding statement.” </p>


<p id="gVp0AG">It simply wasn’t enough. “Steve gave us an ultimatum,” Christie recalls. “He said, You have two weeks. It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.” </p>


<p id="Xhmqyk">So Christie gathered the HI team to make the case that they should all march with him. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="r2OiXS"><q>“It was February of 2005, and we kicked off this two-week death march.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="BDU7ya">“Doing a phone is what I always wanted to do,” he said. “I think the rest of you want to do this also. But we’ve got two weeks for one last chance to do this. And I really want to do it.” </p>


<p id="T7z1Yc">He wasn’t kidding. For a decade, Christie had believed mobile computing was destined to converge with cell phones. This was his opportunity not only to prove he was right, but to drive the spark. </p>


<p id="QCFMqb">The small team was on board: Bas, Imran, Christie, three other designers — Stephen LeMay, Marcel van Os, and Freddy Anzures — and a project manager, Patrick Coffman. They worked around the clock to tie those fragments into a full-fledged narrative. </p>


<p id="DKNV4S">“We basically went to the mattresses,” Christie says. Each designer was given a fragment to realize — an app to flesh out — and the team spent two sleepless weeks perfecting the shape and feel of an inchoate iPhone. And at the end of the death march, something resembling the one device emerged from the exhausted fog of the HI floor. </p>


<p id="Ls2B0F">“I have no doubt that if I could resurrect that demo and show it to you now, you would have no problem recognizing it as an iPhone,” Christie says. There was a home button — still software-based at this point — scrolling, and the multitouch media manipulations. </p>


<p id="lZM46F">“We showed Steve the outline of the whole story. Showed him the home screen, showed him how a call comes in, how to go to your Address Book, and ‘this is what Safari looks like,’ and it was a little click through. It wasn’t just some clever quotes, it told a story.” </p>


<p id="4GtjXL">And Steve Jobs did love a good story. </p>

<p id="O5ZNOH">“It was a smashing success,” Christie says. “He wanted to go through it a second time. Anyone who saw it thought it was great. It was great.” </p>


<p id="EPTuhr">It meant that the project was immediately deemed top secret. After the February demo, badge readers were installed on either end of the Human Interface group’s hallway, on the second floor of 2 Infinite Loop. “It was lockdown,” Christie says. “That’s what you say when there’s a prison riot, right? That was the phrase. Yeah, we’re on lockdown.” </p>


<p id="yKhqPK">It also meant they had a lot more work to do. If the touch interface research meetings were prologue, the tablet prototyping the beginning, then this was the second act of the iPhone, and there was much left to be written. But now that Jobs was invested in the narrative, he wanted to show it off, in high style, to the rest of the company. “We had this ‘big demo’ — that’s what we called it,” Ording says. Steve wanted to show the iPhone prototype at the Top 100 meeting inside Apple. “They have this meeting every once in a while with all the important people, saying what the direction of the company is,” Ording tells me. Jobs would invite the people he considered his top one hundred employees to a secret retreat, where they’d present and discuss upcoming products and strategies. For rising Applers, it was a make-or-break career opportunity. For Jobs, the presentations had to be as carefully calibrated as public-facing product launches. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="GVuHT7"><q>“What are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email?” </q></aside></div>


<p id="6JYH9N">“From then until May, it was another brutal haul, to, well…  come up with connecting paragraphs,” Christie says. “Okay, what are the apps we’re going to have? What should a calendar in your hand look like? Email? Every step on this journey was just making it more and more concrete and more real. Playing songs out of your iTunes. Media playback. iPhone software started as a design project in my hallway with my team.” Christie hacked the latest model of the iPod so the designers could get a feel for what the applications might look like on a device. The demo began to take shape. “You could tap on the mail app and see how that kind of works, and the web browser,” Ording says. “It wasn’t fully working, but enough that you could get the idea.” </p>


<p id="FWIDZN">Christie uses one word to describe how the team toiled around the clock, you might have noticed, above all others. It was “brutal, grueling work. I put people in hotel rooms because I didn’t want them driving home. People crashed at my house,” he says, but “it was exhilarating at the same time.” </p>


<p id="nf6lFi">Steve Jobs had been blown away by the results. And soon, so was everyone else. The presentation at Top 100 was another smash success. </p>


<h1 id="1W1dBR">
<strong>The Bod of an iPod </strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="W1YZR0">When Fadell heard that a phone project was taking shape, he grabbed his own skunkworks prototype design of the iPod phone before he headed into an executive meeting. </p>


<p id="yLa1q9">“There was a meeting where they were talking about the formation of the phone project on the team,” Grignon says. “Tony had [it] in his back pocket, a team already working on the hardware and the schematics, all the design for it. And once they got the approval for it from Steve, Tony was like, ‘Oh, hold on, as a matter of fact’— <em>whoochaa!</em> Like he whipped it out, ‘Here’s this prototype that we’ve been thinking about,’ and it was basically a fully baked design.” </p>


<p id="UUsrHv">On paper, the logic looks impeccable: The iPod was Apple’s most successful product, phones were going to eat the iPod’s lunch, so why not an iPod phone? “Take the best of the iPod and put a phone in it,” Fadell says. “So you could do mobile communications and have your music with you, and we didn’t lose all the brand awareness we’d built into the iPod, the half a billion dollars we were spending getting that known around the world.” It was that simple. </p>


<p id="l69kjh">Remember that while it was becoming clear inside Apple that they were going to pursue a phone, it wasn’t clear at all what that phone should look or feel like. Or how it would work, on just about every level. </p>


<p id="BRNKJM">“Early 2005, around that time frame, Tony started saying there’s talk about them doing a phone,” says David Tupman, who was in charge of iPod hardware at the time. “And I said, ‘I really want to do a phone. I’d like to lead that.’ He said, ‘No.’ ” Tupman laughs. “ ‘You can’t do that.’ But they did a bunch of interviews, and I guess they couldn’t find anybody, so I was like, ‘Hello, I’m still here!’ Tony was like, ‘Okay, you’re it.’ ” </p>


<p id="wBI4Ii">The iPod team wasn’t privy to what had been unfolding in the HI group. </p>


<p id="ZhvfxA">“We were gonna build what everyone thought we should build at the time: Let’s bolt a phone onto an iPod,” says Andy Grignon. And that’s exactly what they started to do. </p>


<h1 id="ko2XlY"><strong>What’s It Going to Be? </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="uoJTfB">Richard Williamson found himself in Steve Jobs’s office. He’d gone in to discuss precisely the kind of thing that nobody wanted to discuss with Steve Jobs — leaving Apple. </p>


<p id="vUI5qX">For years, he had been in charge of the team that developed the framework that powered Safari, called WebKit. Here’s a fun fact about WebKit: Unlike most products developed and deployed by Apple, it’s open-source. Here’s another: Until 2013, Google’s own Chrome browser was powered by WebKit too. It’s big-deal software, in other words. And Williamson was, as <em>Forbes</em> put it, “what’s commonly referred to as a ‘@#$ rock star’ in Silicon Valley.” But he was getting burned out on upgrading the same platform. </p>


<p id="9WcXNR">“We had gone through three or four versions of WebKit, and I was thinking of moving to Google,” he says. “That’s when Steve invited me.” </p>


<p id="xg2VWj">And Steve wasn’t happy.</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gZ0DXo">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="cTXrhR">When you think “successful computer engineer,” the stock photo that springs to mind is pretty much what Williamson looks like — bespectacled, unrepentantly geekish, brainy, wearing a button-down shirt. We met for an interview at a Palo Alto sushi joint that eschewed waiters in favor of automated service via table-mounted iPads. Seemed fitting. </p>


<p id="RLWlrc">Williamson is soft-spoken, with a light British accent. He seems affable but shy — there’s a slightly anxious undercurrent to his speech — and unmistakably sharp. He’s apt to rattle off ideas pulled from a deep knowledge of code, industry acumen, and the philosophy of technology, sometimes in the same breath. </p>

<p id="slKGNr">In the mid-‘80s, a friend convinced Williamson to start a company writing software for the Commodore Amiga, an early PC. “We wrote a program called Marauder, which was a program to make archival backups of copy-protected disks.” He laughs. “That’s kind of the diplomatic way of describing the program.” Basically, they created a tool that allowed users to pirate software. “So we had a little bit of a recurring revenue stream,” he says slyly. </p>


<p id="96d6Ak">In 1985, Steve Jobs’s post-Apple company, NeXT, was still a small operation, and hungry for good engineers. There, Williamson met with two NeXT officers and one Steve Jobs. He showed them the work that he’d done on the Amiga, and they hired him on the spot. The young programmer would go on to spend the next quarter of a century in Jobs’s— and the NeXT team’s— orbit, working on the software that would become integral to the iPhone. </p>


<p id="uWdsTA">“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="J6dts7"><q>“Don’t leave,” Jobs said, according to Williamson. “We’ve got a new project I think you might be interested in.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="2f5fNQ">So Williamson asked to see it. “At this point, there was nobody on the project from a software perspective, it was all just kind of an idea in Steve’s mind.” It didn’t seem like a convincing reason for Williamson to pass up an enticing new offer. “Google was interested in giving me some very interesting work too, so it was a very pivotal moment,” he says. </p>


<p id="mzeMIi">“So I said, ‘Well, the screen isn’t there, the display tech is kind of not really there.’ But Steve convinced me it was. That the path would be there.” Williamson pauses for a second. “It’s all true about Steve,” Williamson says with a quick smile. “I was with him since NeXT, and I’ve fallen under his glare many times.” </p>


<p id="zOC7VU">What would it be, then? Of course, Williamson would stay. “So I became an advocate at that point of building a device to browse the web.” </p>


<h1 id="cgFs0b">
<strong>Which Phone</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="DTiXB8">“Steve wanted to do a phone, and he wanted to do it as fast as he could,” Williamson says. But which phone? </p>


<p id="E8dlpC">There were two options: (a) take the beloved, widely recognizable iPod and hack it to double as a phone (that was the easier path technologically, and Jobs wasn’t envisioning the iPhone as a mobile computing device but as a souped-up phone), or (b) transmogrify a Mac into a tiny touch-tablet that made calls (which was an exciting idea but frayed with futuristic abstraction).</p>


<p id="VukiZw">“After the big demo,” Ording says, “the engineers started to look into, What would it take to actually make this real? On the hardware side but also the software side,” Ording says. To say the engineers who first examined it were skeptical about its near-term viability would be an understatement. “They went, ‘Oh my God, this is— we don’t know, this is going to be a lot of work. We don’t even know how much work.’ ” </p>


<p id="2UIBel">There was so much that needed to be done to translate the multitouch Mac mass into a product, and one with so many new, unproven technologies, that it was difficult even to put forward a roadmap, to conceive of all of its pieces coming together.<strong> </strong></p>


<h1 id="JXZVuw">
<strong>For Those About to Rokr</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="BWIe04">Development had continued on the Rokr throughout 2005. “We all thought the Rokr was a joke,” Williamson says. The famously hands-on CEO didn’t see the finished Rokr until early September 2005, right before he was supposed to announce it to the world. And he was aghast. “He was like, ‘What else can we do, how can we fix it?’ He knew it was subpar but he didn’t know how bad it was going to be. When it finally got there, he didn’t even want to show it onstage because he was so embarrassed by it,” Fadell says. </p>


<div id="2ic7Pr"><div></div></div>


<p id="OIIJWo">During the demonstration, Jobs held the phone like an unwashed sock. At one point the Rokr failed to switch from making calls to playing music, leaving him visibly agitated. So, at about the same moment that Jobs was announcing “the world’s first mobile phone with iTunes” to the media, he was resolving to make it obsolete. He helped by lavishing praise on the new iPod Nano, clearly elevating it as the star of the show and reportedly leaving Motorola execs fuming. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="4gLzC2"><q>Rokr’s sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise</q></aside></div>


<p id="69z2jN">“When he got offstage he was just like, ‘Ugh,’ really upset,” Fadell says. The Rokr was such a disaster that it landed on the cover of <em>Wired</em> with the headline “You Call This the Phone of the Future?” and it was soon being returned at a rate six times higher than the industry average. Its sheer shittiness took Jobs by surprise — and his anger helped motivate him to squeeze the trigger harder on an Apple-built phone. “It wasn’t when it failed. It was right after it launched,” Fadell says. “This is not gonna fly. I’m sick and tired of dealing with bozo handset guys,” Jobs told Fadell after the demo. </p>


<p id="oWo4eO">“That was the ultimate thing,” Fadell says. “It was, ‘Fuck this, we’re going to make our own phone.’ ” </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kA5CbC">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="K7EN5Y">“Steve called a big meeting in the boardroom,” Ording says. “Everyone was there, Phil Schiller and Jony Ive and whoever.” He said, “Listen. We’re going to change plans…  We’re going to do this iPod-based thing, make that into a phone because that’s a much more doable project. More predictable.” That was Fadell’s project. The touchscreen effort wasn’t abandoned, but while the engineers worked on whipping it into shape, Jobs directed Ording, Chaudhri, and members of the UI team to design an interface for an iPod phone, a way to dial numbers, select contacts, and browse the web using that device’s tried-and-true click wheel. </p>


<p id="RsuEfJ">There were now two competing projects vying to become the iPhone — a “bake-off,” as some engineers put it. The two phone projects were split into tracks, code-named P1 and P2, respectively. Both were top secret. P1 was the iPod phone. P2 was the still-experimental hybrid of multitouch technology and Mac software. </p>


<p id="oMeap7">If there’s a ground zero for the political strife that would later come to engulf the project, it’s likely here, in the decision to split the two teams — Fadell’s iPod division, which was still charged with updating that product line in addition to prototyping the iPod phone, and Scott Forstall’s Mac OS software vets — and drive them to compete. (The Human Interface designers, meanwhile, worked on both P1 and P2.) </p>


<p id="OSmvdM">Eventually, the executives overseeing the most important elements of the iPhone — software, hardware, and industrial design — would barely be able to tolerate sitting in the same room together. One would quit, others would be fired, and one would emerge solidly — and perhaps solely — as the new face of Apple’s genius in the post-Jobs era. Meanwhile, the designers, engineers, and coders would work tirelessly, below the political fray, to turn the Ps into working devices in any way possible. </p>


<h1 id="eHa8EM"><strong>The Purple People Leader</strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="oBtBaN">Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple. </p>


<p id="36Tdqy">“One of the buildings we have up in Cupertino, we locked it down,” said Scott Forstall, who had managed Mac OS X software and who would come to run the entire iPhone software program. “We started with one floor”— where Greg Christie’s Human Interface team worked — “We locked the entire floor down. We put doors with badge readers, there were cameras, I think, to get to some of our labs, you had to badge in four times to get there.” He called it the Purple Dorm because, “much like a dorm, people were there all the time.” </p>


<p id="2jULzH">They “put up a sign that said ‘Fight Club’ because the first rule of Fight Club in the movie is that you don’t talk about Fight Club, and the first rule about the Purple Project is you do not talk about that outside of those doors,” Forstall said. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="3Y18zh"><q>Every top secret project worth its salt in intrigue has a code name. The iPhone’s was Purple. </q></aside></div>


<p id="D7Sj7r">Why Purple? Few seem to recall. One theory is it was named after a purple aardvark toy that Scott Herz — one of the first engineers to come to work on the iPhone — had as a mascot for Radar, the system that Apple engineers used to keep track of software bugs and glitches throughout the company. “All the bugs are tracked inside of Radar at Apple, and a lot of people have access to Radar,” says Richard Williamson. “So if you’re a curious engineer, you can go spelunking around the bug-tracking system and find out what people are working on. And if you’re working on a secret project, you have to think about how to cover your tracks there.” </p>


<p id="1T8QiT">Scott Forstall, born in 1969, had been downloading Apple into his brain his entire life. By junior high, his precocious math and science skills landed him in an advanced-placement course with access to an Apple IIe computer. He learned to code, and to code well. Forstall didn’t fit the classic computer-geek mold, though. He was a debate team champ and a performer in high-school musicals; he played the lead in <em>Sweeney Todd</em>, that hammy demon barber. Forstall graduated from Stanford in 1992 with a master’s in computer science and landed a job at NeXT. </p>

<p id="5R8Jpi">After releasing an overpriced computer aimed at the higher education market, NeXT flailed as a hardware company, but it survived by licensing its powerful NeXTSTEP operating system. In 1996, Apple bought NeXT and brought Jobs back into the fold, and the decision was made to use NeXTSTEP to overhaul the Mac’s aging operating system. It became the foundation on which Macs— and iPhones— still run today. At Jobs-led Apple, Forstall rose through the ranks. He mimicked his idol’s management style and distinctive taste. <em>BusinessWeek</em> called him “the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.” </p>


<p id="rna8mw">One of his former colleagues praised him as a smart, savvy leader but said he went overboard on the Jobs-worship: “He was generally great, but sometimes it was like, just be yourself.” Forstall emerged as the leader of the effort to adapt Mac software to a touchscreen phone. Though some found his ego and naked ambition distasteful — he was “very much in need of adulation,” according to one peer, and called “a starfucker” by another — few dispute the caliber of his intellect and work ethic. “I don’t know what other people have said about Scott,” Henri Lamiraux says, “but he was a pleasure to work with.” </p>


<p id="i9jw5e">Forstall led many of the top engineers he’d worked with since his NeXT days — Henri Lamiraux and Richard Williamson among them — into the P2 project. Williamson jokingly called the crew “the NeXT mafia.” True to the name, they would at times behave in a manner befitting a close-knit, secretive (and highly efficient) organization. </p>


<h1 id="NLgfqF"><strong>P1 Thing After Another </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="62X3nV">Tony Fadell was Forstall’s chief competition. </p>


<p id="UrxvsE">“From a politics perspective, Tony wanted to own the entire experience,” Grignon says. “The software, the hardware… once people started to see the importance of this project to Apple, everyone wanted to get their fingers in it. And that’s when the epic fight between Fadell and Forstall began.” </p>


<p id="RP0Vuz">Having worked with Forstall on Dashboard, Grignon was in a unique position to interface with both groups. “From our perspective, Forstall and his crew, we always viewed them as the underdogs. Like they were trying to wedge their way in,” Grignon says. “We had complete confidence that our stack was going to happen because this is Tony’s project, and Tony’s responsible for millions upon millions of iPod sales.” </p>


<p id="3OSoFX">So, the pod team worked to produce a new pod-phone cut from the mold of Apple’s ubiquitous music player. Their idea was to produce an iPod that would have two distinct modes: the music player and a phone. “We prototyped a new way,” Grignon says of the early device. “It was this interesting material…  it still had this touch sensitive click wheel, right, and the Play/Pause/Next/Previous buttons in blue backlighting. And when you put it into phone mode through the UI, all that light kind of faded out and faded back in as orange. Like, zero to nine in the click wheel in an old rotary phone, you know, ABCDEGF around the edges.” When the device was in musicplaying mode, blue backlighting would show iPod controls around the touch wheel. The screen would still be filled with iPod-style text and lists, and if you toggled it to phone mode, it’d glow orange and display numbers like the dial of a rotary phone. </p>


<p id="hiFjFa">“We put a radio inside, effectively an iPod Mini with a speaker and headphones, still using the touch-wheel interface,” Tupman says. </p>

</div>


<p id="NoG0fw">“And when you texted, it dialed — and it worked!” Grignon says. “So we built a couple hundred of them.” </p>


<p id="0Ta209">The problem was that they were difficult to use as phones. “After we made the first iteration of the software, it was clear that this was going nowhere,” Fadell says. “Because of the wheel interface. It was never gonna work because you don’t want a rotary dial on the phone.” </p>


<p id="0hGNn6">The design team tried mightily to hack together a solution. </p>


<p id="kd5o0R">“I came up with some ideas for the predictive typing,” Bas Ording says. There would be an alphabet laid out at the bottom of the screen, and users would use the wheel to select letters. “And then you can just, like, <em>click-click-click-click</em> — ‘Hello, how are you.’ So I just built an actual thing that can learn as you type — it would build up a database of words that follow each other.” But the process was still too tedious. </p>


<p id="1xTNz4">“It was just obvious that we were overloading the click wheel with too much,” Grignon says. “And texting and phone numbers — it was a fucking mess.” </p>


<p id="G8rJmc">“We tried everything,” Fadell says. “And nothing came out to make it work. Steve kept pushing and pushing, and we were like, ‘Steve.’ He’s pushing the rock up a hill. Let’s put it this way: I think he knew, I could tell in his eyes that he knew; he just wanted it to work,” he says. “He just kept beating this dead horse.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="YIzCc9"><q>“I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ” </q></aside></div>


<p id="etXNOv">“C’mon, there’s gotta be a way,” Jobs would tell Fadell. “He didn’t just want to give up. So he pushed until there was nothing there,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="cTCmyH">They even filed for a patent for the ill-fated device, and in the bowels of Cupertino, there were offices and labs littered with dozens of working iPod phones. “We actually made phone calls,” Grignon says. </p>


<p id="5Pk9iX">The first calls from an Apple phone were not, it turns out, made on the sleek touchscreen interface of the future but on a steampunk rotary dial. “We came very close,” Ording says. “It was, like, we could have finished it and made a product out of it… But then I guess Steve must have woken up one day like, ‘This is not as exciting as the touch stuff.’ ” </p>


<p id="DUq06v">“For us on the hardware team, it was great experience,” David Tupman says. “We got to build RF radio boards, it forced us to select suppliers, it pushed us to get everything in place.” In fact, elements of the iPod phone wound up migrating into the final iPhone; it was like a version 0.1, Tupman says. For instance: “The radio system that was in that iPod phone was the one that shipped in the actual iPhone.” </p>


<h1 id="vbHFHx"><strong>Hands Off </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="XHsJVN">The first time Fadell saw P2’s touch-tablet rig in action, he was impressed — and perplexed. “Steve pulled me in a room when everything was failing on the iPod phone and said, ‘Come and look at this.’ ” Jobs showed him the ENRI team’s multitouch prototype. “They had been getting, in the background, the touch Mac going. But it wasn’t a touch Mac; literally, it was a room with a PingPong table, a projector, and this thing that was a big touchscreen,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="zm5jwz">“This is what I want to put on the phone,” Jobs said.</p>


<p id="ksDXAz">“Steve, sure,” Fadell replied. “It’s not even close to production. It’s a prototype, and it’s not a prototype at scale — it’s a prototype table. It’s a research project. It was like eight percent there,” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="6AOyel">David Tupman was more optimistic. “I was like, ‘Oh, wow, yeah, we <em>have</em> to find out a way to make this work.’ ” He was convinced the engineering challenges could be solved. “I said, ‘Let’s just sit down and go through the numbers and let’s work it out.’ ” </p>

<p id="ch7Swa">The iPod phone was losing support. The executives debated which project to pursue, but Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, had an answer: Neither. He wanted a keyboard with hard buttons. The BlackBerry was arguably the first hit smartphone. It had an email client and a tiny hard keyboard. After everyone else, including Fadell, started to agree that multitouch was the way forward, Schiller became the lone holdout. </p>


<p id="Kj0w3V">He “just sat there with his sword out every time, going, ‘No, we’ve got to have a hard keyboard. No. Hard keyboard.’ And he wouldn’t listen to reason as all of us were like, ‘No, this works now, Phil.’ And he’d say, ‘You gotta have a hard keyboard!’ ” Fadell says. </p>


<p id="jjj48q">Schiller didn’t have the same technological acumen as many of the other execs. “Phil is not a technology guy,” Brett Bilbrey, the former head of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group, says. “There were days when you had to explain things to him like a grade-school kid.” Jobs liked him, Bilbrey thinks, because he “looked at technology like middle America does, like Grandma and Grandpa did.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="X53DEg"><q>“[Schiller] was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="dJIX5l">When the rest of the team had decided to move on multitouch and a virtual keyboard, Schiller put his foot down. “There was this one spectacular meeting where we were finally going in a direction,” Fadell says, “and he erupted.” </p>


<p id="mCw0W1">“We’re making the wrong decision!” Schiller shouted. </p>


<p id="VEtYJ5">“Steve looked at him and goes, ‘I’m sick and tired of this stuff. Can we get off of this?’ And he threw him out of the meeting,” Fadell recalls. Later, he says, “Steve and he had it out in the hallway. He was told, like, Get on the program or get the fuck out. And he ultimately caved.” </p>


<p id="pqb4QD">That cleared it up: the phone would be based on a touchscreen. “We all know this is the one we want to do,” Jobs said in a meeting, pointing to the touchscreen. “So let’s make it work.” </p>


<h1 id="5d0IZm"><strong>Round Two </strong></h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="WBvz7O">“There was a whole religious war over the phone” between the iPod team and the Mac OS crew, one former Apple executive told me. When the iPod wheel was ruled out and the touch ruled in, the new question was how to build the phone’s operating system. This was a critical juncture — it would determine whether the iPhone would be positioned as an accessory or as a mobile computer. </p>


<p id="I0MFQM">“Tony and his team were arguing we should evolve the operating system and take it in the direction of the iPod, which was very rudimentary,” Richard Williamson says. “And myself and Henri and Scott Forstall, we were all arguing we should take OS X” — Apple’s main operating system, which ran on its desktops and laptops — “and shrink it down.” </p>


<p id="hmTfnD">“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do,” Williamson says. </p>


<p id="9q0gIE">The NeXT mafia saw an opportunity to create a true mobile computing device and wanted to squeeze the Mac’s operating system onto the phone, complete with versions of Mac apps. They knew the operating system inside and out — it was based on code they’d worked with for over a decade. “We knew for sure that there was enough horsepower to run a modern operating system,” Williamson says, and they believed they could use a compact ARM processor — Sophie Wilson’s low-power chip architecture — to create a stripped-down computer on a phone. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="uNCLQq"><q>“There were some epic battles, philosophical battles about trying to decide what to do.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="9pGmob">The iPod team thought that was too ambitious and that the phone should run a version of Linux, the open-source system popular with developers and open-source advocates, which already ran on low-power ARM chips. “Now we’ve built this phone,” says Andy Grignon, “but we have this big argument about what was the operating system it should be built on. ’Cause we were initially making it iPod-based, right? And nobody cares what the operating system in an iPod is. It’s an appliance, an accessory. We were viewing the phone in that same camp.” </p>


<p id="aO1bth">Remember, even after the iPhone’s launch, Steve Jobs would describe it as “more like an iPod” than a computer. But those who’d been in the trenches experimenting with the touch interface were excited about the possibilities it presented for personal computing and for evolving the human-machine interface. “There was definitely discussion: This is just an iPod with a phone. And we said, no, it’s OS X with a phone,” Henri Lamiraux says. “That’s what created a lot of conflict with the iPod team, because they thought they were the team that knew about all the software on small devices. And we were like, no, okay, it’s just a computer.” </p>


<p id="aCf10o">“At this point we didn’t care about the phone at all,” Williamson says. “The phone’s largely irrelevant. It’s basically a modem. But it was ‘What is the operating system going to be like, what is the interaction paradigm going to be like?’ ” In that comment, you can read the roots of the philosophical clash: The software engineers saw P2 not as a chance to build a phone, but as an opportunity to use a phone-shaped device as a Trojan horse for a much more complex kind of mobile computer. </p>


<h1 id="bgQhz3">
<strong>The Incredible Shrinking Operating System</strong> </h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="ayNIYO">When the two systems squared off early on, the mobile-computing approach didn’t fare so well.</p>


<p id="TxrqhX">“Uh, just the load time was laughable,” Andy Grignon says. Grignon’s Linux option was fast and simple. “It’s just kind of <em>prrrrrt</em> and it’s up.” When the Mac team first got their system compiling, “it was like six rows of hashtags, <em>dink-dink-dink-dink-dink</em>, and then it just sat there and it would shit the bed for a little bit, and then it would finally come back up and you’d be like, Are you even kidding me? And this is supposed to be for a device that just turns on? Like, for real?” </p>


<p id="JdK3Yy">“At that point it was up to us to prove” that a variant of OS X could work on the device, Williamson says. The mafia got to work, and the competition heightened. “We wanted our vision for this phone that Apple was going to release to become a reality,” Nitin Ganatra says. “We didn’t want to let the iPod team have an iPod-ish version of the phone come out before.” </p>


<p id="ULLgJv">One of the first orders of business was to demonstrate that the scrolling that had wowed Jobs would work with the stripped-down operating system. Williamson linked up with Ording and hashed it out. “It worked and looked amazingly real. When you touched the screen, it would track your finger perfectly, you would pull down, it would pull down.” </p>


<p id="87p4aF">That, Williamson says, put the nail in the Linux pod’s coffin. “Once we had OS X ported and these basic scrolling interactions nailed, the decision was made: We’re not going to go with the iPod stack, we’re going to go with OS X.” </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="CKB6ls">The software for the iPhone would be built by Scott Forstall’s NeXT mafia; the hardware would go to Fadell’s group. The iPhone would boast a touchscreen and pack the power of a mobile computer. That is, if they could get the thing to work. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AUGaMW">It’s a literal road to nowhere. Stretching out from a roundabout outside the Robin Hood Airport in Doncaster, a small village in Northern England, it’s a wholly unremarkable stretch of slowly cracking pavement, bushes, and weeds, an idle strip of asphalt near long-term parking and a bland business park.</p>


<p id="qYjSY7">For 35-year-old runner Simon Wheatcroft, however, this stretch of unused roadway may as well be his gym, training center, and proving grounds, his own private version of the 72 stone steps that make up a Rocky montage. Wheatcroft knows every inch of this one-third-mile strip of asphalt — from the contours of the roadway to the feeling of its double yellow lines of paint under his sneakers. Despite the mind-numbing bore of jogging such a short length in endless loops, Wheatcroft had to memorize it. He’s blind. </p>


<p id="5e3Hr5">Imagine getting up from your desk or couch, closing your eyes, and walking to the other end of the room, or perhaps crossing the street in midday traffic. Most people wouldn’t have the audacity to do that without guidance or aid. Meanwhile, Wheatcroft has run the New York and Boston marathons, covered 100 miles in the Sahara Desert, and — perhaps most impressive — sprinted solo alongside the curving roads and streets of his small corner of rural England, sometimes alongside oncoming traffic, all without the benefit of actually seeing where he was going. Instead, he used the twin yellow lines on the side of the road, feeling them through his sneakers, to avoid stepping into the road. (Cars usually make it a point to avoid hitting people, he says, and honestly, they hate cyclists more.) </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="vBIKgj"><q>Wheatcroft knows every inch of this one-third-mile strip of asphalt</q></aside></div>


<p id="aaCucb">For the last few months, Wheatcroft has been training along these roads with renewed intensity. Though he’s finished countless races and even ultramarathons, he’s now focused on the New York Marathon, the premier event of its kind. He’s completed the race twice before, but this year carries another challenge. Thanks to the technology of a Brooklyn-based startup called WearWorks, and their prototype wearable navigation device, Wheatcroft aims to be the first blind runner to cover the course unaided and unassisted. </p>


<p id="7DklJI">When it comes to technology developed for the visually impaired, “the biggest thing is accessibility and affordability,” says Wheatcroft. “How do we make visually impaired people more mobile? If these technologies exist, eventually they trickle down to people, and everybody uses them.” </p>


<p id="3aktRW">The New York Marathon represents an edge case, a stress test, an extreme. Wheatcroft believes that by finding a way to navigate the route amid thousands of runners, he can help test technology that could assist the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/">quarter of a billion people around the world</a> today who are blind or suffer from vision impairment. Many of the visually impaired don’t have a job — 70–80 percent in the US are unemployed — and suffer varying degrees of mobility and navigational challenges. </p>


<p id="2J4JmH">“It upsets me that so many blind people don't work, and a lot of that is due to mobility,” he says. “We should be at a point where we should be able to solve these things. I want to make better technology for the community as a whole.” </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="qlRrtM">Walking through Doncaster with Wheatcroft, on the route where he takes his sons, Grayson and Franklin, to school, it’s difficult to tell he’s visually impaired. Even when he’s out walking with his guide dog, Ascot, Wheatcroft’s mental map of the surrounding roadways is so acute that he often gives precise directions to people too dependent on their smartphones to find their way without one. </p>


<p id="7Vav00">“People would see me running and ask what I was doing, and eventually, I’d end up telling them where to go,” he says. “‘To your left, there’s a building, about 0.9 miles down the road, then you can turn right.’”</p>


<p id="f5M6S3">Wheatcroft often looks people in the eye when he talks, a force of habit from when he could see. He started losing his vision at 17 due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic condition that also blinded his uncle. (<a href="https://nfb.org/fact-sheet-blindness-and-low-vision">Only 1 percent</a> of Americans who are blind are blind from birth.) At this point, Wheatcroft can only vaguely make out changes in light, or what he calls the “fog of dull color.” (He could tell when I stood in front of him and blocked the afternoon sun.)</p>


<p id="3aAxz8">“When I was young, I thought, ‘Oh, this’ll never really happen,’” he says of going fully blind. “I was always a little bit concerned about the things that I'd miss out on, like I wouldn’t be able to see my kids. That used to plague me. But at the same time, I thought medical science might solve the problem.” </p>

<p id="7JeJcg">Wheatcroft grew up near Doncaster and dreamed of being a fighter jet pilot, but his diagnosis ended that dream. During high school, he rarely talked about his situation. After graduating, he went to college in Sheffield, where he received an undergraduate degree in psychology. He milled around a bit, and eventually worked at a friend’s video game store for a few years before finding a job in IT. At 26, his vision rapidly deteriorated. The shift initially devastated him; he says his situation became “depressing as hell.” Without work, he felt like he had lost purpose. Over time, Wheatcroft found ways to acclimate to his condition — he recalls memorizing the route between local pubs — all part of what he says was a constant adjustment. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="By4oxS"><q>Wheatcroft came back to the UK struggling with what had happened in Yosemite</q></aside></div>


<p id="KMyfHy">But during a three-week vacation traveling across the United States in 2009, Wheatcroft was reminded of his limits. He had planned to propose to his girlfriend Sian at the summit of Half Dome in Yosemite, California, a romantic vista accessible via an arduous hike. But Wheatcroft had trouble navigating the ascent, and as they crossed the tree line, Wheatcroft, with a ring in his pocket, became exhausted. The loose ground and steep incline were proving difficult. Light rain started falling, making the route even more treacherous. Sian asked him to stop and rest, and when he sat down at the halfway point, he realized he had to turn back. In the end, Wheatcroft proposed to Sian at the base of the mountain during a snack break. A few weeks later, still crisscrossing the US, they wed in Las Vegas. </p>


<p id="y6RGLz">Wheatcroft came back to the UK struggling with what had happened in Yosemite. He decided to take a “voluntary redundancy” and quit working. His failure to propose at the summit ate at him for weeks, then months. What if he kept giving up on his aspirations because he was blind? </p>


<p id="JvSc5l">It was then time that Wheatcroft picked up a book given to him by an old university teacher: <em>Ultramarathon Man</em> by Dean Karnazes, a famed ultramarathon runner. Wheatcroft, who wasn’t very involved in sports as a teenager, thought that if Karnazes could endure long distances, and find significance and self-confidence in running, maybe he could, too. The idea marinated in his head for a few months. Maybe running could be his way to overcome obstacles, like the one that had forced him down the mountain.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="ltc556">In 2010, Wheatcroft started practicing in what he thought was a safe space: a soccer field in the back of an elementary school in Doncaster. He had done some weight lifting and CrossFit in high school and into his 20s, but this was different. Wheatcroft barely had the money to afford serious training: he ate candy bars from the corner store as a cheap source of calories, and wrote to Brooks running shoes, explaining his cash-strapped situation, and got a free pair of shoes in the mail. Sprinting between posts in endless loops, he’d feel out the paint on the grass to help himself navigate, but it was far from foolproof. Occasionally he’d run into a dog walker, a post, or someone who just assumed he could see and swerve around them. Eventually he moved to the empty airport road and, after gaining confidence, ventured out onto surrounding streets and roadways. </p>


<p id="H32jmK">“Had I not lived here, I don't think I'd have even been able to start training,” he says. “Right location right time, more than anything.”</p>


<p id="hcERA1">In 2011, inspired by Karnazes and feeling confident after six months of training, Wheatcroft attempted his first ultramarathon: a 100-mile race in the Cotswolds, a rural area of rolling hills in South-Central England. At mile 83, he was dragged off the race when he could no longer stand. But he didn’t stop running. </p>

<p id="wn2FDZ">Over the next six years, he would go on to finish numerous marathons and ultramarathons: he ran the Boston Marathon in 2016 (which he finished in four hours and 45 minutes), the New York Marathon twice (in 2014, he finished in five hours and 14 minutes), and even <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/get-inspired/29645457">ran the 220-mile route from New York to Boston</a> over the course of nine days in 2014.</p>


<p id="Z7V4hT">For most of these races, Wheatcroft ran with a guide, his friend Neil Bacon, who’s been running with him for four years. But increasingly, he’s been turning to technology to wean himself off of human guides. He attempted the Four Deserts Marathon in Namibia last May — a 155-mile-long, multi-day race through scorching, shade-free desert where temperatures climbed to 104 degrees Fahrenheit — using corrective navigation technology he helped develop with IBM engineers. The device used a series of audio cues to keep him on track; beeps would steer him and keep him within a virtual corridor mapped out by the program. They named the device “eAscot” after Wheatcroft’s dog. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="gM999t"><q>Wheatcroft ran without Bacon trailing him; he hit an unmapped flagpole 10 miles in</q></aside></div>


<p id="9cFMnw">Wheatcroft says the device functioned well as a proof of concept for corrective navigation, but it was a rush job and had too many functional constraints. The navigational corridor wasn’t tight enough, and the device assumed that the desert would be free of obstacles. On day two, Wheatcroft ran without Bacon trailing him; he hit an unmapped flagpole 10 miles in.  </p>


<p id="JcMryz">Competitive running is a notoriously injury-prone pastime, even for those with full sight. Long-distance runners face twisted ankles, runner’s knee, and shin splints. Wheatcroft says the most significant issues he and other blind runners face is drifting from their paths. He’s clipped countless lampposts and traffic lights during training, and tripped over ditches, piles of dirt, and even garbage left on the road. A few years ago, Wheatcroft was running down a roadway near his home when he unknowingly came upon a battered car, abandoned on the shoulder the day before. Wheatcroft hit the damaged vehicle running at full speed, cutting his shins. Disoriented, he tried to right himself and in the process cut his arms. He got up, dazed, covered in what he thought was sweat. When he realized it was blood, he panicked, unable to see himself, identify his injuries, or find landmarks that could help someone locate him. He located his phone amid the wreckage and called his wife, frantically telling her to come find him. Luckily, she was able to locate him by driving up and down his normal route. </p>


<p id="byK04b">“If I’d have smashed my phone,” Wheatcroft says, “I would have been fucked.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="x7Z8Va">Wheatcroft’s running career coincided with an advance that made his life as a blind person better: the 2009 release of Apple’s iPhone 3GS, the first smartphone with a built-in screen reader, VoiceOver. </p>


<p id="rrs2mf">“It was night and day,” he says. “It wasn’t just about training. Now I could read newspapers. I could cue up a song on Spotify. I can do it now, thanks to that phone.”</p>


<p id="EQ7Iek">More important for Wheatcroft is the issue of mobility. Despite a massive market, one that’s forecast to grow as baby boomers age, there has been no truly affordable or readily attainable breakthrough navigation technology for the visually impaired. Meanwhile, the established everyday aids are imperfect: canes require environmental cues to work, and can’t provide directions to the store; guide dogs can master an area or a series of tasks, but can’t immediately learn a new neighborhood, or help navigate through an unfamiliar city. </p>


<p id="R6LXeh">“The basic skills we need to navigate aren’t the challenge,” says Karl Bélanger, a technology expert at the National Federation for the Blind. Canes and guide dogs work, he says, for general, day-to-day navigation. But it’s important to have supplements to basic mobility, especially in specialized circumstances.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="KY6yzj"><q>“That’s why the dog and cane still reign supreme.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="sak5yE">Some new technologies have offered steps forward: Google Glass, in conjunction with a subscription service called <a href="https://aira.io/">Aira</a>, can “see” for the blind. Aira give the visually impaired immediate access to a remote, sighted assistant who can tell them what’s in their field of vision. (<a href="http://www.wcvb.com/article/new-technology-will-help-blind-runner-during-boston-marathon/9263250">Erich Manser</a> used Aira to run the Boston Marathon earlier this year.) It’s incredible technology, but it’s also expensive — the unlimited plan for Aira costs $329 a month — which may explain why Aira has less than a thousand subscribers. Other programs and devices, such as Microsoft’s Seeing Eye, tap phone cameras and visual recognition software to help navigate certain scenarios, but they don’t offer wider navigation cues. Not to mention, with constant need for power and a Wi-Fi connection, they’re limiting.</p>


<p id="Riqe0n">“That’s why the dog and cane still reign supreme,” says Wheatcroft. “The only input a dog needs is food.” </p>


<p id="9pOpSi">The first technology Wheatcroft experimented with was a relatively basic app called <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>, which simply told him how far he had gone with regular audio reminders. Those reminders helped jog his memory and maintain focus, as well as create detailed mental maps of his surroundings.</p>

<p id="0j4AOF">“It was just a data point, but that data point was like a comfort blanket,” he says. “That voice helped tell me what to do, and that almost becomes your internal voice. If I didn’t have that technology, I wouldn’t have had the extra confidence to go out.” </p>


<p id="eG06Jn">Now, Wheatcroft trains with Runkeeper and uses a treadmill at home; it’s a Nordic model that’s hooked up to a program called iFit to run preprogramed routes, practice pacing, and get used to inclines and markers on his upcoming routes. </p>


<p id="Hp6pUQ">During races and long runs, Wheatcroft, like many other blind runners, relies on a much more low-tech way of getting around: human guides. Professional blind runners rely on volunteers and practice partners who are literally tethered to them by ropes in order to help them avoid hitting anything or anyone on the course. It’s both a liberating, and limiting, factor. </p>


<p id="EW4c5t">“When you ask people why they run, it’s normally about freedom and independence, to go out and push yourself,” Wheatcroft says. “But you can only push yourself as much as the person you’re connected to.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="pUOAJq"><q>“But you can only push yourself as much as the person you’re connected to.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="ZLagGb">New Yorker Charles-Edouard Catherine, also a blind runner, is a member of <a href="https://www.achillesinternational.org/">Achilles International</a>, an organization that helps pair volunteers and athletes with a variety of disabilities, including vision impairment, autism, and amputations. With chapters in more than 60 countries, the group fields a large team at marathons and other running events; at the New York Marathon, the group can field over 300 athletes with nearly 700 accompanying guides. (Many racers have multiple guide runners.) Catherine, who also has retinitis pigmentosa, says his first time running with Achilles in 2012 was life-changing. </p>


<p id="NFdBIM">“When you become blind, you get in a phase of denial where you do not want to accept the new condition you're in, the new requirements that it implies. You don't like to ask for help. I didn't know what to do,” he says. “It was awkward. But I paired up with people depending on speed and level, and right away, it felt like a new community.”</p>


<p id="burwLr">Catherine started running regularly with Achilles, and he quickly realized the advantages and limits of running with a guide. He felt camaraderie with fellow runners, who would share the experience of a long race with him, and having someone with him to warn other runners and pedestrians to get out of the way felt like having a presidential escort. But the more Catherine trained, the more dependent he felt. </p>


<p id="k4KKDY">“I always need someone,” he says. “And that's limiting. In New York in February, if it's snowing and frozen, and you want to do hill repeats, you're not going to find lots of volunteers.” </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="wTm0M0">Most of the technology Wheatcroft has used to date relies on audio cues. But audio is a constricting form of communication. Imagine a Siri or Alexa-like interface describing every single object in your field of vision. Consider the cognitive overload that it would create on an already loud street crowded with obstacles. </p>


<p id="0s3W82">“When I’m walking down the street to my house, hearing that there’s a bush or a lamppost doesn’t really help me,” Wheatcroft says. “Just help me avoid it.” </p>


<p id="9K7Gel">That’s why Wheatcroft has become increasingly focused on the sense of touch. Haptic technology, Wheatcroft believes, can steer a visually impaired person without overloading their senses. A haptic device could be called up by a voice command to access existing GPS data for directions, then “steer” someone via gentle taps on their skin. (The system could be combined with additional sensor systems, or even a service animal or cane, to help avoid obstacles, grade changes, and immediate impediments.)  </p>


<p id="nKBJCG">Earlier this year, Wheatcroft went searching for a company working on a haptic solution. That’s how he came across WearWorks. </p>


<p id="749YbH">Co-founded by a trio of graduate students at New York’s Pratt Institute, WearWorks traces its origins, at least in part, to visions of a kung fu suit and an “iTunes for movement.” </p>


<p id="iJL9wI">Keith Kirkland, a dreadlocked designer and engineer born in Camden, New Jersey, knew his way around clothing. A graduate of the Fashion Institute and Technology, a freelancer for Calvin Klein, and a one-time handbag engineer for Coach (“every bag has to be stress-tested to hold 150 pounds,” he says), Kirkland was inspired to explore haptic design while working on 3D modeling. An ex-girlfriend saw him hunched over a computer from across the room, noticed his poor posture, then walked over and shifted his shoulders. </p>


<p id="q3WjCl">“What if you could read my body posture and compare it to what’s right, all without being there?” he remembers thinking at the time. “What does it look like to have movement fully digitized?” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Pt0kzf"><q>“What does it look like to have movement fully digitized?”</q></aside></div>


<p id="wyAmjK">He spent months trying to fashion a crude prototype, which was the foundation for his thesis at Pratt. Imagine Neo uploading his martial arts mastery into <em>The Matrix </em>as a file. The end result was a crude punching meter, a sleeve that would measure the strength of a strike. The project fell apart due to the difficulty of connecting wires and motors to the elastic sleeve, but it got Kirkland thinking about haptics and feedback: how can we communicate movement instruction via touch? </p>


<p id="sMelII">Kirkland partnered with two classmates, Yangyang Wang, and Kevin Yoo, a sculptor and painter turned industrial designer who had worked with Wang for a 2015 competition called America’s Greatest Makers for Intel. The million-dollar contest, focused on wearable technology, was a perfect place to pool their design skills to work on designing a better haptic interface. </p>


<p id="7DcfTM">The team’s original idea was to create a general market notification device, but then Yoo remembered the story of Marcus Engel, a famous blind author and consultant, who Yoo once heard speak. (Engel would later become a friend and adviser for the group.) The team began discussing how they could create a device that could help the visually impaired navigate, “offloading” the communication of directions from verbal to tactile. </p>


<p id="HniAzh">WearWorks’ early Wayband prototype didn’t win at the Intel competition, but a few weeks later, it did help them become fellows at the Next Top Makers incubator, an event sponsored by the New York Business Development Corporation. The recognition helped the team take the device to SXSW last year, and landed them a spot in the Urban-X incubator in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood, where they recently finished a year-long residency. That’s where Wheatcroft came upon the group, and began working with them to develop and refine the technology. </p>


<p id="tXpjHk">“What they’ve understood is that it’s not about the maps. It’s about how you communicate with a person,” says Wheatcroft. “With verbal systems, you need to lose one of your senses for directions; hearing becomes dedicated to navigation. By using touch, which isn’t often used, you still leave audio free.” </p>

<p class="caption">The system developed by WearkWorks that utilizes GPS to create a map and route</p>
</div></div>


<p id="SotYw3"></p>


<p id="35qhXT">The core technology behind the Wayband is relatively simple: users pair the Wayband with their phone, and it utilizes GPS to create and map a route. The path is surrounded by virtual “fencing,” and any time a user steps in the wrong direction, or approaches a mapped object or obstacle, the band buzzes in a sort of Morse code. (Four quick taps on the bracelet signal a turn left, for example, while two long taps signal a right turn.) It’s corrective navigation. Testing out an early version of the device at the Urban-X accelerator earlier this summer, I found myself slowly spinning in circles, eventually righting myself after getting the hang of the haptic cues. Kirkland compares it to creating an alphabet and vocabulary from scratch. </p>


<p id="LYchUc">“Keep it functional and simple,” says Yoo. “We actually went to the National Federation for the Blind, and they told us high-tech canes and proximity sensors are great, but what really would help us is wayfinding.”</p>


<p id="k3eNZB">Instead of reinventing navigation, or relying on new computer models, the device simply creates a more easy-to-understand, universal system of directions, which connects to a GPS mapping system. The team is quick to note this doesn’t entirely solve the problem of navigation; though the Wayband can steer a blind person to the Post Office, it can’t help them avoid a pothole or cross a street. For that, Wheatcroft will be partnering the Wayband with an ultrasonic device the team devised to help with micro-scale navigation. Called the Tortoise, the green plastic device, roughly measuring two inches square and strapped to Wheatcroft’s chest, broadcasts and receives ultrasonic vibrations. (The antennae looks like the small bump of a camera on a smartphone.) The Tortoise’s constant, low-level vibration will speed up when the reflected waves indicate another runner or object is close. </p>


<p id="9t6y5q">Catherine, who became one of a number of blind consultants for the WearWorks team after they reached out to him, loves the concept behind the technology. </p>


<p id="igpQuP">“You have this bittersweet feeling. Why haven’t we figured this out five years ago?” he says. “I think this technology has been there for a long time.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="L8lUCJ"><q>“You have this bittersweet feeling. Why haven’t we figured this out five years ago?”</q></aside></div>


<p id="CD8biQ">Throughout the last year, WearWorks and Wheatcroft have refined the technology. He tested an early prototype in April, and it was impressive enough that he was almost ready to use it for the actual race. During a visit to New York City in September, Wheatcroft briefly ran around Central Park with the updated device. </p>


<p id="ai2N4w">Wheatcroft loves the Wayband system because it’s what he calls a “safe sandbox.” Instead of running within a wide digital corridor between 10–50 meters wide (the system he developed with IBM), WearWorks’ Wayband works within a 2.5-meter corridor, which offers more accuracy and safety, especially in a race environment.</p>


<p id="ZwQkTp">For the marathon, he’ll wear a larger armband-sized version of the device in addition to the Tortoise. Neil Bacon, Wheatcroft’s longtime guide runner, will be at the race as a precaution, but won’t be helping Wheatcroft along on this record-breaking attempt. </p>


<p id="A6h58n">“My main concern is running into somebody,” Wheatcroft says. “If this is their first marathon, and they’ve been training for years, I don’t want to be the bloody idiot who runs into them and takes them out.” </p>


<p id="QxysIB">After the race, WearWorks plans to begin selling early versions of the Wayband, including an armband-sized version for athletes, similar to what Wheatcroft will be wearing, starting at $300. </p>


<p id="wcm4L1">Catherine says the potential independence this device promises would be like going from a child to an adult, a graduation. It would be a different race. But he knows exactly what he’d like to do first. </p>


<p id="6gto5J">“I would really love to guide someone else,” he says. “I would like to be on the other side.” </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="bKQeFp">Wheatcroft’s bet on a haptic, rather than audio, navigation system was a smart one: the New York Marathon engulfs runners in noise. </p>


<p id="RnEpoM">Started in 1970 as a race that took place entirely within Central Park and had roughly 100 spectators, the New York City Marathon has become the largest and most important race of its kind. Last year, a record-setting 51,394 runners, representing every state in the US and 124 countries completed a course that winds through each of New York City’s five boroughs. More than a million cheering and screaming fans, along with bands, DJs, and announcers, line the 26.2-mile course.</p>


<p id="7T2vbx">This year’s race took place on Sunday, November 5th. At 7AM, runners started to gather in  corrals on Staten Island. They were itchy with nervous energy, ready to shed blankets and jackets, and — after long mornings of commuting on boats, buses, and trains to the edge of Staten Island — eager to just run. </p>


<p id="icoc3v">Wheatcroft’s day started at 5AM with coffee, oatmeal, and so many press calls to UK media that he didn’t even have time to talk to his family. By 9:15, he was at the starting line, part of group of athletes with disabilities that include other blind runners (and guides from Achilles International) as well as those using handcycles. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="bngxcs"><q>They were itchy with nervous energy, ready to shed blankets and jackets</q></aside></div>


<p id="qTUPhq">The 24 hours before the marathon were full of last-minute preparations. Wheatcroft and the WearWorks team ran final trials in Central Park on the eve of the race, and discovered that the ultrasonic sensor wasn’t sensing objects in Wheatcroft’s vicinity. That night, the WearWorks team huddled at a Thai restaurant in Manhattan to hack together a solution, and Yoo fabricated a new module overnight. Yoo, who was going to run with Wheatcroft to observe the Wayband and Tortoise in action, made last-minute adjustments to the devices. </p>


<p id="fn6Rx5">Press swarmed over Wheatcroft with questions and photographers snapped photos. <em>New York Times</em> reporter Jeré Longman was there, and would shadow Wheatcroft for the first few miles. Runners in front of Wheatcroft started asking members of the entourage if they should know who he was. </p>


<p id="SlzGzW">Minutes before the start, a stoic Wheatcroft, more serious and slightly more rigid than he was back in England, slipped out of his black tracksuit. At 9:57, as a slight drizzle fell on the crowd, the start gun was fired and the pack of hundreds began to move. Wheatcroft hung at the rear, and was one of the last of his group to begin crossing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. </p>


<p id="xCKJLS">Wheatcroft was running as the forward point in an invisible triangle. Though he was navigating independently, his guide runners, who previously guided him at the Boston Marathon last year, ran 10 feet behind. As Wheatcroft cleared the bridge with a smooth, steady gait, Bacon and Croak hung back, giving him a wide lead. A water station appeared in Wheatcroft’s path and both guides bit their tongues to avoid tipping him off. This was the Tortoise’s first test. Wheatcroft felt the device vibrate faster, so he slowed down and weaved around the obstacle. </p>


<p id="LVZy7k">“Then it became a totally different race,” says Bacon. “I’d never seen him dodge things like that on his own. The hard thing was standing back and letting him go. ”</p>


<p id="mXvLS5">From there, Wheatcroft continued through Brooklyn and Queens, picking up the pace, enjoying the freedom provided by the twin devices. Bacon and Croak, accustomed to chatting with Wheatcroft, hung back. They watched him avoid large groups of runners, the Tortoise functioning like it was meant to. </p>


<p id="xHHzq4">“At the beginning, it was like, ‘Oh my god, we’re doing it,’” says Wheatcroft. “It was exactly how I imagined we’d avoid people in the crowd. I was running faster because I was enjoying it working.”</p>


<p id="PHoM2l">But the team didn’t count on rain. Around mile 15, the functionality of the Tortoise, which had been steadily deteriorating as rainfall picked up, stopped working. At the same time, the Wayband was having difficulty picking up signals. The sheer volume of data and cellular traffic along the route didn’t help, says Yoo. </p>

<p id="id7cBt">“We had every single problem possible,” Yoo would later say, during a post-race stretch near the finish. “There was lots of high-rises causing signal issues, issues with navigation while crossing bridges. We did the hardest thing we could do: testing the Wayband during the marathon.”</p>


<p id="zEXEBt">As the navigation aids faltered, Wheatcroft found himself working more, forced to concentrate harder to move ahead. Combined with his early surge, he began to feel drained. By the time they crossed the East River and headed through Manhattan, Bacon, Croak, and Yoo assumed typical guide duties. As the group passed through Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Wheatcroft and his guides ran side by side. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="CUH40R"><q>As the group passed through Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Wheatcroft and his guides ran side by side</q></aside></div>


<p id="SCwjO6">Wheatcroft crossed the finish line at 3:15PM, five hours and 17 minutes after the start, with Yoo and Bacon flanking him. Over the last leg of the marathon, he demonstrated the same steady gait he had at the start, but it was clear he was spent. Huddled under two blankets and clutching a cup of sugary, milky tea in the finish area, he said the sheer amount of mental energy required to navigate with the system added to the physical exhaustion of the race. He expelled too much energy at the beginning, and didn’t anticipate the energy needed to navigate. </p>


<p id="J5Ayje">After Wheatcroft crossed the finish line, he put his arm around Bacon and flashed a grin. He appeared excited and relieved to have met the physical challenges of the race. But the unproven technology, which showed promise under the harshest of conditions, ultimately didn't last the entire marathon, and Wheatcroft was unable to finish unaided.</p>


<p id="3aLMPf">I asked Bacon what he thought of the entire thing: he felt it was a great success. Exhausted, Wheatcroft couldn’t muster up a response:“Right now, I really don’t know. I’m too tired to think,” Wheatcroft said. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="JUiol3">In the hours after the race, Yoo cataloged improvements for next time: the software algorithm needs to sort out data discrepancies better, the hardware needs to stand up to more duress, and they need a better GPS system. WearWorks clearly doesn’t have the budget to launch a fleet of satellites, but Yoo believes a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/25/16362296/gps-accuracy-improving-one-foot-broadcom">mass-market GPS chip</a> coming to the smartphone market next year will allow accuracy to within roughly a foot, and significantly improve the performance of their system. </p>


<p id="cJhj15">Despite being exhausted, Wheatcroft lit up a little when asked about the future of the Wayband after the marathon. </p>


<p id="9yXpbm">“We took something we always knew was going to be an intense test,” he says. “We tested so many worst-case scenarios. Let’s take the lessons learned, and see how we can improve it.”</p>


<p id="0ciuN9">Wheatcroft is already looking toward the future, and even more strenuous challenges. Already an advocate and an occasional speaker, next, he’d like pursue triathlons. In addition, he’s consulted with tech companies about inclusivity and designing for the visually impaired, and he’s continuing his studies, including computer coding. (He’s currently working at home with a braille reader, and pursuing a master’s in computer science.) Wheatcroft wants to be more than a runner; eventually, he doesn’t just want to test the technology, he wants to help develop and build it. </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="zAHU0l">“As a blind person, you always strive for independence,” says Wheatcroft. “But it’s a bit of a contradiction, because oftentimes, you’re using somebody with sight to become independent. What we’re trying to do is use this technology to really achieve true independence. This race isn’t about time, it’s proving that something is possible.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="VwhanS">Samir Soneji had no idea what he was getting into when he agreed to talk about the potential risks of vaping at the first US E-Cigarette Summit in Washington, DC this past May. His first clue was the booing.</p>


<p id="T36HEe">As a professor at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, Soneji studies how gaps in tobacco regulation affect health. Two years before the conference, he’d reported in <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2020785"><em>JAMA Pediatrics</em></a> that young people who smoke hookah or use “snus,” a form of moist smokeless tobacco, are twice as likely to try cigarettes as kids who don’t. He suspected that e-cigarettes, with kid-friendly flavors like “Cinnamon Roll” and “Peanut Butter Cup,” carried a similar risk. And that’s exactly what he and several colleagues discovered in a <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2634377">recent review</a> of studies that tested that possibility. </p>


<p id="KRPM2y">Evidence that tobacco companies targeted teens and nonsmokers with <a href="https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm532563.htm">candy- and fruit-flavored cigarettes</a> prompted the Food and Drug Administration to ban them in 2009 under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. But those restrictions do not apply to e-cigarettes and hookahs, even though the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm506676.htm">extended its authority</a> in August 2016 to include all forms of tobacco.  </p>


<div class="c-float-right"><div id="pUyUb0">
<div class="c-entry-sidebar">
  <h3 id="ILqH3K">Key points</h3>
<ul>
<li id="BXcSqL">The e-cigarette market is expected to be&nbsp;worth $34 billion by 2021, and is&nbsp;increasingly dominated by tobacco&nbsp;companies such as Reynolds American and Altria (formerly known as Philip Morris).</li>
<li id="uXp6FI">Studies into the argument that vaping leads to smoking cessation continue to have mixed findings. Meanwhile, studies on the health risks of vaping have different results based on whether they were funded by tobacco companies, or non-affiliated public researchers.</li>
<li id="SJqBUa">Big Tobacco has been developing e-cigarette devices since the early 1960s, but eventually avoided marketing them because, according to executives,&nbsp;smokeless tobacco “complicates our efforts&nbsp;to resist the FDA’s attempts to regulate the tobacco industry.”</li>
<li id="LyvLex">Major tobacco companies&nbsp;co-opted and heavily invested in the promotion of the concept of “harm reduction,” as opposed to smoking cessation, as a means of gaining access to public health experts and&nbsp;casting themselves as socially responsible corporations. It is the same argument vaping promoters use today.</li>
<li id="womMb2">E-cigarette manufacturer NJOY and importer Smoking Everywhere have hired the same firms that previously helped the tobacco industry&nbsp;evade regulation&nbsp;and&nbsp;defeat smokers’ liability claims&nbsp;for years. Their allies have hired&nbsp;law firms that have successfully defended major tobacco companies from class action lawsuits.</li>
<li id="XvO97l">Philip Morris, Reynolds American, and its allies paid lobbyists nearly $1.2 million to fight a California bill to prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes in vending machines and regulate them like any other tobacco product.</li>
<li id="TE916d">Tobacco and vaping industries spent nearly $10 million to fight regulations on e-cigarettes and related legislation in California since 2009.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div></div>


<p id="86cwf8">Soneji figured that people who came to a conference about the science and regulation of e-cigarettes actually wanted to hear the latest science, whatever the data showed. So he told the audience what he and others had found: youth who vaped were more likely to start smoking cigarettes than those who didn’t. What’s more, kids who made the leap from e-cigs to cigarettes probably wouldn’t otherwise have started smoking, he explained, because they didn’t suffer from anxiety or depression or use alcohol or drugs — risk factors associated with youth smoking. He also shared evidence that “fun” candy-flavored e-cigarettes attract kids, just as flavored cigarettes did, and that, because labels often misrepresent <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/40/6/403/2237800/Concentration-of-Nicotine-and-Glycols-in-27">nicotine levels in the devices</a>, even kids who think they’re vaping only flavors could be inhaling nicotine. </p>


<p id="WCrG4g">The booing was not the only sign to Soneji that this was not a typical scientific conference. He later joined a Q&amp;A panel before the morning break. There, a Johns Hopkins researcher who said he consults for pharmaceutical companies and Reynolds American — which makes VUSE, the top-selling e-cig brand in the US — asked the panel when public health officials were going to communicate positive messages about how vaping reduces harm, like they do about using clean needles and condoms to stem the spread of disease. Soneji said it would be premature and dangerous to recommend e-cigarettes to help smokers quit, given the lack of rigorous scientific evidence to support it. Minutes later, the head of an anti-smoking organization rose from the audience to dismiss his call for more evidence as “rubbish.” The crowd laughed and cheered.</p>


<p id="F2WtBO">Many people in the audience, Soneji would discover, had an emotional or financial interest in vaping — and they didn’t pay up to $1,100 a ticket to hear anyone question the benefits of e-cigarettes. “I didn’t realize just how many people would be from the industry, and whose job and livelihood is [tied] to e-cigarettes,” he says. “Hearing about the harms of vaping came across as threatening to their existence.” </p>


<p id="fGDla2">Many people Soneji spoke to after his talk argued that e-cigarettes save lives. They told him it’s the tar in cigarette smoke that causes lung cancer, and since e-cigarettes don’t have tar, there’s nothing to worry about. An ex-smoker-turned-vaper who had opened a vape shop to help others quit smoking told Soneji that his products were safer because they don’t produce cancer-causing tar. While that’s true, Soneji says, “he was very dismissive of any cardiovascular effects around vaping and nicotine, and around the chemical by-products of heating the e-juice.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="YaDxuH"><q>“Hearing about the harms of vaping came across as threatening to their existence.” </q></aside></div>


<p id="HEmqSO">Public health campaigns have so successfully tied smoking to lung cancer that people often don’t realize more smokers die of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases than of lung cancer. Soneji tried to tell the shop owner, and many others at the summit, that smoking significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and that <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2600166">recent studies</a> suggest e-cigarettes also increase heart attack risk. But they didn’t listen to him. They didn’t understand how anyone could question the value of a product they believe helps people quit one of the world’s deadliest habits.</p>


<p id="9p4hWj">Online forums are filled with stories from ex-smokers who saw striking health improvements after switching to vaping. “I no longer wake up coughing and hacking up gunk for the first two hours of my day. I'm no longer getting winded doing the smallest things,” reported a member of the E-Cigarette Forum, which calls itself “the voice of vaping since 2007.” </p>


<p id="HIIk25">Ex-smokers offer similar testimonials on vaping forums, blogs, and social media groups. The vaping advocacy group Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association, or CASAA, sells <a href="https://casaa.org/product/vaping-saves-lives-t-shirt/">a T-shirt</a> to drive home the point: “Vaping saves lives.”     </p>


<p id="avDBNU">After the e-cigarette summit, a media outlet called Vaping360 <a href="http://vaping360.com/ecig-summit-washington/">described Soneji</a> as “the speaker with the most tedious and pedestrian boilerplate anti-vaping agenda,” and attacked him and his co-authors as “a who’s who of <a href="http://vaping360.com/vaping-gateway-smoking/">terrible vaping researchers</a>.” </p>


<p id="lZNSCA">The attacks on Soneji are similar to those lobbed at any individual who speaks out about the possible harms of vaping. On the Facebook page for the 2016 pro-vaping movie <em>A Billion Lives</em>, a woman who described herself as a tobacco treatment specialist dared to say, “We don’t know yet the exact repercussions of vaping because it hasn’t been around long enough. But we do know it causes [scarring] in the lungs.”</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="fqi6w1"><q>The attacks on Soneji are similar to those lobbed at any individual who speaks out about the possible harms of vaping</q></aside></div>


<p id="T2UaBr">Within minutes, a man who’d just posted about how vaping helped him quit smoking told her: “STFU you are an idiot and a moron. Clearly you don’t know wtf to say cause you would rather people smoke.” The next comment is too profanely misogynistic to print. </p>


<p id="kgj8Bh">It’s hard to overestimate the power of personal experience. But personal anecdotes, no matter how plentiful or powerful, are no substitute for scientific evidence derived from rigorously designed studies that test alternate hypotheses and control for confounding factors. Scientists are just beginning to test the effects of vaping on the human lung. A <a href="http://ajplung.physiology.org/content/313/2/L193.long">recent review</a> of studies concluded that e-cigarette use may cause “significant” toxicity to the lung, but noted that more research is needed. Long-term studies clearing e-cigarettes as reasonably safe alternatives to cigarettes have not been done. But that hasn’t stopped some vaping advocates from claiming they have.</p>


<p id="uyvDV8">And they can easily find compromised or less-than-complete studies to support their case. In April, <a href="https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/raba-aet041117.php">British American Tobacco, or BAT — a major player in the vaping market and the largest tobacco company in the world — reported</a> that vapor from its Vype e-pen barely affects disease-related genes in a simulated human airway. In a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00188?src=recsys&amp;">previous study</a>, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00188?src=recsys&amp;">BAT asserted</a> that the device produces 95 percent fewer toxic chemicals than a conventional cigarette. In 2015, a report from Public Health England, an executive agency of the UK’s Department of Health, deemed e-cigarettes 95 percent less harmful than cigarettes. But the conclusion was <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00042-2/fulltext?rss=yes">based partly on research funded</a> by organizations and scientists with ties to tobacco and e-cigarette companies. Two years earlier, a study funded by CASAA reported that e-cigarettes pose minimal risk to users and bystanders. </p>


<p id="L8s2Zr">Publicly funded published studies from researchers with no ties to tobacco or vaping interests, by contrast, have shown that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463913001533">chemicals</a> in e-cigarette vapor <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00170.2016">suppress genes</a> involved in immune defense in human nasal epithelial cells, include <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b01741">known respiratory irritants and carcinogens</a>, <a href="http://ajplung.physiology.org/content/313/1/L52.long#sec-26">impair the function of epithelial cells that protect the lungs</a>, and contain <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463913001533">ultrafine particles and nicotine</a> that could harm vapers and bystanders. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="Et1FdZ"><q>Studies across diverse subjects show that industry-funded research tends to favor the study’s sponsor</q></aside></div>


<p id="socMvc">Why such different conclusions? No one has yet systematically compared the results of vaping studies funded by vested interests to those funded by independent sources, but studies across diverse subjects show that industry-funded research tends to favor the study’s sponsor. And we know, thanks to once-secret documents released through leaks and litigation, that tobacco companies <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/10/3/218">spent billions of dollars</a> to undermine evidence that cigarettes harm smokers and bystanders. In the <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=qsly0042">infamous Whitecoat Project</a>, Philip Morris hired <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=hxym0071">law firms</a> to find scientists, <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/55/8/588.long">aka “whitecoats,”</a> who would help “resist and roll back smoking restrictions,” a plan detailed in a formerly <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=khww0048">confidential 1988 memo</a>, and <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=khww0048">keep the controversy about the hazards of secondhand smoke alive.</a> </p>


<p id="Qto9Ts">Just a decade ago, the vaping industry — which includes devices that typically heat nicotine-containing liquids to produce inhalable vapors — was largely the province of small businesses. Today, the market, which is valued at over $10 billion and expected to be <a href="http://blog.euromonitor.com/2017/06/latest-research-tobacco-2017-edition-data.html">worth $34 billion by 2021</a>, is <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/01/18/906615/0/en/Global-E-cigarette-Vaporizer-Device-and-Aftermarket-Analysis-and-Forecast-2016-2025-Big-Tobacco-Companies-Taken-Over-the-47-Billion-Industry-Through-a-Series-of-Mergers-and-Acquisi.html">increasingly dominated by tobacco</a> companies such as Reynolds American and Altria (formerly known as Philip Morris). </p>


<p id="KhuWz2">Many <a href="http://www.aemsa.org/featured-link/sfata/">vaping advocates </a><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/329829-the-rise-of-vaping-has-nothing-to-do-with-big-tobacco">say they’re competing with Big Tobacco</a>, which they fear will <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/08/dont-let-big-tobacco-choke-the-e-cigarette-industry/">stifle innovation</a>. They say that <a href="https://www.atr.org/electronic-cigarettes-should-not-be-taxed-tobacco-products">taxes on e-cigarettes</a> will penalize smokers trying to quit and that regulations requiring companies to disclose the ingredients in e-juice and conform to quality standards will bankrupt small entrepreneurs. Some may well be trying to put the tobacco industry out of business. But others have joined forces with some of the same actors and have deployed the same tactics <a href="http://toxicology.usu.edu/endnote/Bero-AnnRevPubHealth24-100901.pdf">the tobacco industry used to stoke doubts</a> about smoking’s dangers while marketing “safer” delivery systems. They’re enlisting veteran tobacco industry law firms to contest federal oversight in court and partnering with tobacco-funded libertarian groups to fight regulation in states and cities, and they’re rallying armies of ex-smokers who believe vaping saved their lives. </p>

<h1 id="pWsk9Y">Turning Public Health Experts into the Enemy</h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="GprxDR">For decades, tobacco control experts worked together to counter marketing campaigns that made smoking sexy. Hard-hitting TV spots featuring smokers disfigured by cancer and speaking through voice boxes, or hooked up to oxygen tanks and gasping for air helped drive a decline in smoking that had begun <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/index.htm">in the 1960s</a>. But health alliances forged to stop smoking began to crumble in the mid-2000s with the advent of campaigns to promote “reduced harm” products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes. While some of these products — including nicotine patches, lozenges, and gums — have received FDA approval to treat nicotine addiction after clinical trials showed they were safe and effective, others, including smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes, have not. </p>


<p id="GdyFKo">E-cigarettes are theoretically safer than cigarettes because they don’t burn tobacco, which produces a noxious mixture of toxic and cancer-causing substances, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and heavy metals like cadmium and arsenic. Instead, the battery-powered devices produce an aerosol mist by heating “e-juice,” which typically contains flavors and nicotine dissolved in solvents (propylene glycol or vegetable or both) that minimize evaporation until the cocktail is inhaled. Proponents of harm reduction, who advocate offering reduced-risk products to those who can’t stop smoking, argue that giving e-cigarettes to smokers is like providing clean needles to IV drug users: individuals can satisfy their craving while reducing their overall disease burden. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="CUGDcL"><q>Proponents of harm reduction argue that giving e-cigarettes to smokers is like providing clean needles to IV drug users</q></aside></div>


<p id="WEBM82">But for a harm-reduction argument to be valid, policy makers need strong evidence that vaping improves smokers’ health without creating a new set of risks — to both users and nonusers. So far, the evidence for quitting is mixed, while long-term safety remains unknown. A systematic review of studies of e-cigarettes and smoking cessation <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub3/full">published last year</a> reported that two clinical trials offer evidence that vaping leads to quitting, but cautioned that they were too small to have confidence in the results. Meanwhile, another <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(15)00521-4/abstract">review published last year</a>, which included a broader range of studies, concluded that people who used e-cigarettes were actually less likely to quit smoking. </p>


<p id="T34Ryp">Assessing risks to vapers and bystanders associated with chemicals in e-cigarette vapor has proven difficult because manufacturers keep changing the devices, which now come in over 460 brands and <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/23/suppl_3/iii3">close to 8,000</a> different flavors. </p>


<p id="Qs0F80">Some vaping advocates insist that e-cigarettes emit only harmless water vapor — echoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403100952/http://www.usacig.com/faq.aspx">marketing claims</a> — and propylene glycol, the same ingredient used in fog machines. The FDA has deemed e-cigarette flavorings and the solvents propylene glycol and glycerin “generally recognized as safe” for use in food, but that has little bearing on whether they’re safe to inhale. Several studies have detected a range of toxic chemicals in e-cigarette vapor, including <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/15-10185/">diacetyl</a>, which is associated with the severe respiratory disease known as “popcorn lung”; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrey_Khlystov/publication/310823078_Flavoring_Compounds_Dominate_Toxic_Aldehyde_Production_during_E-Cigarette_Vaping/links/583f1a4f08ae8e63e6182588.pdf">aldehydes</a>, which are probable carcinogens; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23467656/">acrolein</a>, a potent irritant often found in air pollution; and the cancer-causing tobacco-specific nitrosamines that are also found in cigarette smoke. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575993">few studies</a> of people working with theatrical fog machines found that those working closest to the machines had reduced lung capacity — and they weren’t repeatedly sucking propylene glycol into their lungs like vapers do. What’s more, several studies report that heating propylene glycol and glycerin <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fsrep42549.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">under normal vaping conditions</a> can produce an array of toxic chemicals, including <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173055">benzene</a>, a known human carcinogen, and fine particles, which can cause heart disease.  </p>


<p id="gKKVUe">Levels of toxic chemicals found in e-cigarette vapor are typically far lower than those found in tobacco smoke, but no one knows the long-term effects of inhaling them.</p>


<p id="FHTA0y">To figure out whether e-cigarettes reduce harm to smokers, the devices would have to undergo rigorous testing in several clinical trials, just as other nicotine-replacement therapies have. That hasn’t happened. When the Public Health England panel concluded that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than cigarettes, it relied on assumptions about risks, not on data derived from carefully controlled studies. </p>


<p id="POBYx1">“Theoretical benefits are not evidence,” says Jonathan Klein, scientific director for the American Academy of Pediatrics Julius B. Richmond Center of Excellence, which studies tobacco. To get evidence on relative risks, at a minimum you’d need to track the disease rates of separate groups of people using different products to see if vaping reduces disease outcomes, Klein says. And if you want to protect public health, you’d prevent nonsmokers and young people from getting addicted, he says. “But that’s not the way it’s been approached.” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="d1NvJo"><q>“Theoretical benefits are not evidence.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="iXlQ9S">Soneji says you could classify e-cigarettes as a net population benefit if the devices were better than cold turkey at helping adult smokers quit, and they didn’t attract children. Then they’d resemble conventional nicotine-replacement therapy, otherwise known as NRT (think Nicorette gum or Chantix pills). “No kids are really interested in NRT,” Soneji says. “And NRT is better than cold turkey for smokers interested in quitting.” </p>


<p id="NSBb2c">And though e-cigarette lobbyists compare vaping to needle exchange or methadone treatment, there’s a critical difference, Soneji says: unlike e-cigarettes, methadone isn’t designed to attract people who aren’t already addicted. “It’s not like you can buy mint-flavored methadone.” </p>


<p id="KYJMMh">E-cigarettes, by contrast, are mass-marketed in flavors that appeal to kids, who can buy them online by clicking a link that says they’re 18 or older. In 2011, at least four years after e-cigarettes hit the US market, just over 3 percent of 6th through 12th graders had tried e-cigarettes. By 2013, over 8 percent had tried vaping. More than a quarter-million kids who’d never smoked cigarettes had tried vaping that year, researchers reported in <a href="https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/documents/2016_sgr_full_report_non-508.pdf"><em>Nicotine and Tobacco Research</em></a><em>; </em>they were nearly twice as likely to start smoking conventional cigarettes as kids who didn’t vape. By 2015, e-cigarette use among teens had skyrocketed to 27 percent, surpassing the use of every other tobacco product. In 2017, e-cigarette use among teens dropped for the first time, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0615-youth-tobacco.html">latest survey</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though e-cigarettes are still the most favored tobacco product.</p>


<p id="FfxUTo">Alarmed by the uptake among kids, former surgeon general Vivek Murthy called the devices a “<a href="https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/documents/2016_sgr_full_report_non-508.pdf">major public health concern”</a> in a report on e-cigarettes last year, which the vaping industry and its allies roundly condemned. William Godshall, a longtime anti-smoking activist who promotes vaping as harm reduction, accused Murthy of lying about vapor research and threatening the lives of vapers and smokers on <a href="https://ejuicemonkeys.com/news/godshall-chronicles-122216/">eJuiceMonkeys.com</a>, which posts his newsletter. The site also posted similar reprisals from the vaping industry and its allies.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="FE7giA"><q>former surgeon general Vivek Murthy called e-cigarettes a “major public health concern”</q></aside></div>


<p id="nH5SmN">Pro-vaping blogs and online forums regularly praise studies that serve their aims and condemn those that don’t. And that’s where many of the roughly 8 million vapers and owners of the rapidly rising number of vape shops and lounges — at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0071.htm">8,500 last year</a> and counting, according to the CDC journal <em>Preventing Chronic Disease </em>— get their information. They’re also exchanging information at the growing number of meet-ups and conventions where enthusiasts can mingle with like-minded souls, geek out over the latest gear, and watch “cloud chasers” compete to blow the most impressive vapor plumes. At conventions like VapeCon, they can stock up on free samples or take a selfie with a seductively dressed Miss VapeCon. For many, vaping isn’t just a habit, it’s a way of life.</p>


<p id="9Jh2qo">So when <em>The Simpsons</em> mocked industry claims that they didn’t market to kids a few years ago, many vapers weren’t amused. In the episode, Bart goes to the Kwik-E-Mart to buy e-cigs, and Apu tells him that while they’re legal for children in their state, “this is not kid stuff.” Then Apu asks, “Now would you like bubble gum flavor, strawberry shortcake, or watermelon dream?” A writer for Vaping360 complained that the show played to “common fears and misconceptions.”</p>

<h1 id="z2LKSH">Lying about Nicotine to Avoid Regulation</h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="MQRblm">Vaping advocates often describe e-cigarettes as revolutionary technology that competes with Big Tobacco, and was <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20060196518">patented </a>in 2003 <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20060196518">by Hon Lik</a>, a Chinese pharmacist who wanted to quit smoking. Yet, internal industry documents released through litigation show that tobacco companies created prototypes of electronic cigarettes decades before Lik introduced his product. </p>


<p id="xpmfvg">In 1962, British American Tobacco-contracted <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=nmlk0203">scientists began work on a “smoking device</a>” to deliver nicotine without tar, <a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303806">a review of once-secret documents</a> by Stanford historian Stephan Risi shows, “avoiding the well-known disadvantages inherent in <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=nmlk0203">actual cigarette smoking</a>.” Top brass ultimately deemed the device a hard sell and abandoned it. Another tobacco company, Brown &amp; Williamson, had “made solid progress” on <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=mqvv0205">“radical smoking products”</a> that impart flavor “in the absence of tobacco combustion” by 1989, but ditched the <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=jjjv0199">project</a> to avoid infringing on a patent held by Reynolds. Philip Morris explored electronic nicotine delivery technology in 1990, <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2016/11/15/tobaccocontrol-2016-053406.full#ref-5">scientists reported in the journal <em>Tobacco Control</em> last year</a>, hoping to address health concerns and the proliferation of smoke-free laws. But after the FDA announced in 1994 that it was studying nicotine’s pharmacological effects and whether the industry intended cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to deliver these effects, executives decided the project “complicates our efforts <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=nhfg0175">to resist the FDA’s attempts to regulate the tobacco industry</a>,” and dropped it.</p>


<p id="4HQlrW">The idea then, as now, was to develop a product that reduced the harm of smoking. And as part of that effort, the tobacco industry then, like the vaping industry today, denied the harmful effects not just of tar — which is not present in e-cigarettes — but also of nicotine, which is. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="NhoFK9"><q>In 1962, British American Tobacco-contracted scientists began work on a “smoking device” </q></aside></div>


<p id="0TppQL">In April 1994, two months after the FDA announced it would study nicotine’s effects, the chief executives of the seven largest US tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and Reynolds, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZDQKq2F08">lied under oath</a> before a congressional subcommittee to deny that nicotine is addictive, even as they manipulated nicotine levels to promote addiction. These deceptions came to light in July 1995, when tobacco control researcher <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/389237">Stanton Glantz and his colleagues</a> published the first in a series of papers <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/389243?resultClick=1">that analyzed thousands of formerly confidential industry documents</a>.</p>


<p id="ms9rj5">The next month, <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=51727">President Bill Clinton proposed</a> sweeping regulations to curb teen smoking, noting that the FDA’s 14-month study confirmed that “cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are harmful, highly addictive and aggressively marketed to our young people.” Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco “fall well within the definitions of drug and device,” <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1995-08-11/pdf/95-20052.pdf">the FDA had explained</a>, because they deliver nicotine, a drug that affects the body partly by creating and sustaining addiction as tobacco companies intended. </p>


<div><div id="QNixn8"></div></div>


<p id="3eTm4z">Philip Morris, Reynolds, and a coalition of tobacco interests wasted no time filing lawsuits, using an argument that vaping interests would later tweak. Cigarettes aren’t drugs or devices, they argued, but tobacco products, which the agency has no authority to regulate. The Competitive Enterprise Institute — which now runs interference for the vaping industry — quickly stepped in to ridicule the proposed rules. Caffeine and nicotine affect the same organs, argued Competitive Enterprise Institute general counsel Sam Kazman <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=zrlw0036">in a petition</a>, so the agency may as well regulate caffeinated beverages as drugs and devices. Kazman <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=lzyy0043">acknowledged the petition was a stunt</a>, but tobacco executives took his ploy a step further to <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/15/suppl_4/iv27.full.pdf">argue in court that nicotine is no more harmful</a> than caffeine — a canard promoted by <a href="http://www.tobaccoharmreduction.org/wpapers/006v1.pdf">vaping advocates</a> today. </p>


<p id="GFn8Jy"><a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=flcj0169">Philip Morris paid the Competitive Enterprise Institute $200,000</a> that year as part of its public policy program, and would pay the think tank an additional $445,000 over the next six years. <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=zhvf0094">Reynolds</a> also funded the institute, which in turn joined Americans for Tax Reform and the Heartland Institute in a Reynolds-backed front group called “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805008/">Get Government Off Our Back</a>” (GGOOB) to fight indoor smoking laws and other federal tobacco regulations. </p>


<p id="p1Jagi">As <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=ffvv0089">GGOOB vowed</a> to “protect Americans from the regulators’ heavy-handed tactics,” tobacco companies hashed out what would be the largest civil litigation settlement in US history. Forty-six state attorneys general, five US territories, and the District of Columbia sued the companies for deceptive and fraudulent practices under consumer protection and antitrust laws to recover the substantial health care costs associated with smoking. The so-called Master Settlement Agreement dismissed existing and future suits against the companies in exchange for <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/13/4/356.long">billions</a> in annual payments to compensate the states. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="iFCd28"><q>Tobacco companies co-opted “harm reduction” from an Institute of Medicine report</q></aside></div>


<p id="x5vXYE">But tobacco companies had already hatched plans to reinvent their image — and marginalize <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=ryyk0006">their “enemies</a>.” A review of Philip Morris and British American Tobacco internal documents <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/24/2/182.full">published in <em>Tobacco Control</em> shows</a> <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/24/2/182.full">that the companies</a> co-opted “harm reduction” from an Institute of Medicine report as a way to gain access to public health experts and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10551-012-1250-5%23CR132" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cast themselves as socially responsible corporations</a>. They sought <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=lghb0013">to “challenge the credibility” of those advocating smoking cessation and “cause dissention”</a> by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tobacco control movement. A Philip Morris executive argued in a <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=rhcw0157">formerly confidential document</a> that recent tobacco reforms and legal victories might blind public health groups “to carefully orchestrated efforts by the tobacco industry and its allies to accelerate turf wars and exacerbate philosophical divisions.”</p>


<p id="NUl8wZ">Toward that end, they hired PR firms to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%252Fs10551-012-1250-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">create divisions</a> among tobacco control experts and weaken public health policy by identifying moderates who might promote “safer” products while attacking the credibility of moralistic “extremists” who wouldn’t. </p>


<p id="SAJzP6">It’s impossible to tell whether the tobacco industry’s efforts to cause dissension among tobacco control experts accounts for the polarized debate on vaping today. The industry <a href="https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-8603-4-2">has a history</a> of destroying documents that might have revealed whether they carried out their plans. What’s clear, however, is that the industry continued to call on “<a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=nsbk0093">credible third parties</a>” like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Americans for Tax Reform to fight regulations by attacking inconvenient research results and highlighting “abuses” of government-funded anti-tobacco programs. And now the same third parties are helping vaping interests protect e-cigarettes.</p>


<div><div id="DATYwF">
<div class="c-entry-sidebar">
  <h1 id="Ranbqd">A History of Promoting Reduced Harm</h1>
<p id="NiEbMj">E-cigarettes are the latest in a series of products tobacco companies have claimed reduce the risk of smoking. Public health officials have long urged independent testing of the tobacco industry’s reduced-harm claims — just as they are for e-cigarettes today — earning the wrath of reduced-harm activists who see their calls for evidence as condemning smokers to “quit or die.” </p>
<p id="RdHq3S">David Sweanor, a lawyer with a track record of successful lawsuits against the tobacco industry who considers vaping a public health breakthrough, had similar hopes for Eclipse, a “<a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=mqpn0186" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">reduced risk</a>” cigarette made by Reynolds. The tobacco giant claimed in media talking points, <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=jtwy0221" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">outlined in a formerly confidential document</a>, that the “heat not burn” technology used in Eclipse — which looks like a cigarette but doesn’t burn down, much like an e-cigarette and <a href="https://www.pmi.com/smoke-free-products/iqos-our-tobacco-heating-system" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">Philip Morris’ new iQOS</a> — reduced levels of carcinogens by 80 percent. Reynolds hoped to get Sweanor’s support for its new product, a <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=tlkx0011" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">1999 plan to build “positive awareness”</a> shows. Sweanor was anxious to promote the concept of reduced harm. “I have already done 12 radio interviews on your Eclipse announcement so far today,” he wrote at one point <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=fznh0221" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">in an email </a>to Reynolds’ head of product development. “It is certainly getting attention. Now, hopefully, it can also be tied into both public health goals and commercial realities.” </p>
<div id="Nc2u7V"><div></div></div>
<p id="dsCw4D">Brad Rodu, an oral pathologist who promotes vaping as a less harmful alternative to cigarettes, approached Reynolds with <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=qfdj0091" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">unsolicited advice</a> on marketing Eclipse. Reynolds should emphasize that Eclipse produces fewer toxic chemicals compared with other products because the tobacco isn’t burned, Rodu suggested. </p>
<p id="T1jinu">Rodu, the endowed chair in Tobacco Harm Reduction Research at the University of Louisville’s James Graham Cancer Center — established with over $3 million in unrestricted funds from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco and Swedish Match North America, Inc. —&nbsp;now defends vaping for the R Street Institute, a libertarian think tank founded in 2012 by former Heartland Institute staffers. The Heartland Institute received $325,000 in “public policy” grants from Philip Morris (now known as Altria) in the 1990s; $200,000 from Reynolds and Philip Morris in 2010 and 2011, <a href="http://d35brb9zkkbdsd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1-15-2012-2012-Fundraising-Plan.pdf" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">internal documents</a> leaked to <em>ThinkProgress</em> show; and <a href="http://d35brb9zkkbdsd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1-15-2012-2012-Fundraising-Plan.pdf" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">anticipated receiving</a> another $160,000 from both companies in 2012. Altria has listed R Street as a grantee since 2014. </p>
<p id="Om9isK">Rodu and William Godshall co-wrote a <a href="https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7517-3-37" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">2006 paper</a> for the American Council on Science and Health that promoted alternative sources of nicotine to reduce the risks of smoking. In addition to offering Reynolds marketing tips on Eclipse, Rodu had defended smokeless tobacco as “98 percent safer than smoking” three years earlier at a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg87489/html/CHRG-108hhrg87489.htm" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">US House hearing</a> on tobacco harm reduction. The hearing, called “Can Tobacco Cure Smoking? A Review of Tobacco Harm Reduction,” had been called by Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), who’d received over $89,000 from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco, Reynolds, Philip Morris, and their employees between 1999 and 2004. Echoing Rodu was Richard Verheij, executive vice president of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco, which awarded Rodu a $1.25 million grant in 1999. After the paper came out, Rodu received additional funding from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco as well as grants from Reynolds American, Altria, Swedish Match, and British American Tobacco. </p>
<p id="hKB9zx">The American Council on Science and Health, which describes itself as a defender of “sound science,” received, or expected to receive, at least $419,700 from both cigarette and e-cigarette makers in 2012 and 2013, <a href="https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acsh-financial-summary.pdf" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">documents leaked</a> to <em>Mother Jones</em> show, and continued to receive undisclosed sums from Altria until 2015. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<aside id="7WCvAN"><q>Godshall attacks public health officials as “anti-tobacco extremists”</q></aside><p id="y6Ucwn">In their American Council on Science and Health paper, Godshall and Rodu argued that smokers are told to “quit or die” when government agencies should be telling them that smokeless tobacco is much safer than smoking. Reynolds, which <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xhxj0222" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">had also been thinking</a> about how to counter the “quit or die” narrative, knew it lacked the credibility to “deliver the Harm Reduction message,” and aimed to focus on “utilizing credible third party public health and elected officials” and “driving the wedge between the two opposing ‘Community’ groups deeper and wider.”</p>
<p id="1OZzl5">Reynolds appeared to consider Rodu and Godshall, who says he “never received one dollar from any tobacco or e-cigarette company,” as credible third parties. The company shared Godshall and Rodu’s harm-reduction manifesto in its <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=hhbn0222" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">2008 Corporate Social Responsibility Report</a>. Godshall distributed it on antismoking listservs — <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=ynlm0179" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">blind copying Reynolds’</a> senior director of public issues — and <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=gpjm0179" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">asked top Reynolds executives</a> to give reporters his number so he could correct “biased” journalism. Godshall says at the time he was urging Reynolds to actively promote its new snus product as less hazardous than cigarettes. He originally attributed the blind cc to "email problems," then later said he didn't remember the specific email, and regarded questions about his emails to tobacco executives as a smear campaign. “I talk to anybody I feel can be helpful in reducing disease and death from cigarettes,” he says. “I was called a traitor for even going to talk to the industry.” In a <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=txxd0152" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">letter forwarded</a> to top Reynolds marketing and communications executives, Godshall attacks public health officials as “anti-tobacco extremists” who “are deceiving smokers and the public about the health risks of different tobacco products [and] nicotine.”</p>
<p id="NX2aZy">The courts, however, ruled that it was the tobacco companies that were practicing deception. In 2010, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco’s new owner, Altria, <a href="http://http/www.koskoff.com/Articles/Chewing-Tobacco-Co-Pays-5-Million-for-Mouth-Cancer-Victim-s-Death.shtml" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">paid $5 million</a> to the family of a man who started chewing tobacco when he was 13, unaware of the risks, and died following a diagnosis of tongue cancer. Carl Phillips, former scientific director and former board member for Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives, had testified as an expert witness on behalf of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco. Phillips, who <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=ksgl0001" data-analytics-viewport="related-story" data-analytics-link="related-story">received $20,000 for his work</a>, said he believed smokeless tobacco does not cause tongue or oral cancer, even though the National Toxicology Program had already concluded it does. </p>

<h1 id="GnamJB">Tobacco-funded Libertarians Lend a Hand</h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="6cqtCJ">As of September 2017, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to tax e-cigarettes. Every state except Michigan has at least one law on the books specifically regulating e-cigarettes, and in many states, including Michigan, local governments have adopted stronger rules. Where public health experts see taxes and regulations as proven strategies to reduce the use of tobacco and its alternatives, vaping advocates view the measures as an assault on their livelihood and individual rights. Their campaigns to fight taxes and regulations have been taken up by far-right libertarian activists like Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform, which has received over $1 million from Philip Morris and Reynolds since the mid-1990s. Norquist praised vapers on his podcast for helping to defeat the 2014 reelection bid of a New Mexico state representative who proposed taxing e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and for beating back tax increases in 26 states. </p>


<p id="8Ck8Xy">Last year, Americans for Tax Reform’s Paul Blair joined the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association and the American Vaping Association on a multi-state “Right to Vape” tour to “raise awareness” that the FDA’s proposed regulations on e-cigarettes would destroy the industry. At a stop in Wisconsin, the rally’s emcee introduced an “activist and warrior for the cause,” Aaron Biebert, director of the cinematic valentine to vaping <em>A Billion Lives</em>. In the movie, named for cigarettes’ projected death toll over the next century, Biebert lays out a conspiracy to discredit vaping among puritanical “prohibitionists” who insist smokers “quit or die,” corrupt federal health officials addicted to revenues from tobacco industry taxes and lawsuits, and drug companies intent on quashing their competition. </p>


<div><div id="9oaN5e"><div></div></div></div>


<p id="hEOJSI">Glosses on this theory echo across blogs, social media, vaping forums, and right-wing media channels. Biebert’s vilification of the federal government earned him spots on the Herman Cain Show, hosted by the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and Tea Party favorite, and the <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/heartlanddailypodcast/aaron-biebert-e-cigarettes-and-a-billion-lives/">podcast of the Heartland Institute</a>, the free-market think tank that took money from Exxon while attacking the science of climate change. Perhaps less well-known is that the Heartland Institute, which took at least $325,000 from Philip Morris in the 1990s, also helped the tobacco industry deny the evidence that <a href="https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/july-1998-five-lies-about-tobacco-the-tobacco-bill-wasnt-about-kids">secondhand smoke harms</a> bystanders — and <a href="https://www.heartland.org/_template-assets/documents/publications/1532.pdf">that Philip Morris</a> targeted kids with its Joe Camel cartoons.</p>


<p id="6U2mXn">On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6XmoJyue3Q">Cain’s show</a>, Biebert explained his movie’s central premise: e-cigarettes would save a billion lives if not for corrupt public health officials who lie about the risks of nicotine and vaping to promote innovation-destroying regulations that will kill an industry. “You can tell it’s kind of crooked, because it just doesn’t make sense,” Biebert said. “There’s no science to back it up and here they are shutting down 20,000 businesses, and they don’t care.” (Vapers’ estimates of vape shops tend to run higher than public health officials’.) Biebert went on to say that, time and again, studies show that the air around vapers is no different from “regular air.” Cain, who fought indoor smoking restrictions and <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=lmcf0094">took money from Reynolds</a> as head of the National Restaurant Association, wrapped up the interview saying, “Big Brother has lied again to the American people.” </p>


<div id="kcxuwb"><div></div></div>


<p id="WSg1db"><em>A Billion Lives</em> calls on veteran anti-smoking activists to attack the “anti-tobacco industry” for not promoting vaping as a public health “miracle.” By presenting an alternative to cigarettes, contends David Sweanor, adjunct professor at the Centre for Health Law, Policy and Ethics at the University of Ottawa, vaping offers the “opportunity to do something that would rival the eradication of smallpox.” Godshall, an ardent defender of vaping, describes his idea of the perfect solution to the cigarette epidemic: it would be 99 percent less hazardous than cigarettes, wouldn’t be addicting nonsmokers, wouldn’t encourage anyone to switch to cigarettes, and would help lots of people quit smoking. “And it’s called vaping.”  </p>


<p id="vfrcSH">Both Sweanor and Godshall, who broke with mainstream tobacco control experts over a decade ago, have long promoted alternative tobacco products to reduce the harm associated with smoking (see “A History of Promoting Reduced Harm,” above). </p>


<p id="tA4Vvg">Sweanor told me he believes vaping could force the tobacco industry to stop selling cigarettes. “If the vast majority of the risk is from the smoke, and you can deliver what consumers would like without the smoke in a far less addictive way so you can greatly reduce their health risk and you can facilitate them getting off the product entirely if that's what they want to do,” he asks, “then how do you justify selling cigarettes?”</p>


<p id="xRQr6N">Sweanor believes officials should inform smokers that different tobacco products carry different risks, rather than telling them to quit tobacco. “We've got 6 million plus deaths per year, virtually all because of a dirty delivery system,” he told me. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="WJpUWu"><q>“Maybe e-cigarettes are 50 percent safer, or 25 percent safer, or maybe they are just as bad as cigarettes in ways that we do not know.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="SlFUbn">But are e-cigarettes a clean nicotine delivery system? That’s not what the scientific evidence shows, Soneji says. “Maybe e-cigarettes are 50 percent safer, or 25 percent safer, or maybe they are just as bad as cigarettes in ways that we do not know.”</p>


<p id="qcuQpI">The concerted efforts to discount evidence from studies finding cause for concern about vaping echo the tactics of tobacco industry-funded scientists who questioned the link between cancer and smoking, Soneji notes. They sowed confusion and skepticism to undermine a growing body of evidence of smoking’s harms, which helped delay regulations on cigarettes for decades. The research on e-cigarettes is just beginning, he says, yet advocates are simply dismissing potential harms while cheerleading the benefits of vaping far beyond what the science supports. </p>


<p id="qc8JJd">Godshall, in contrast, insists the science is settled. He blames the “left-wing” media and government-funded scientists for spreading misinformation about the benefits of vaping. “The headlines and the news are confusing and deceiving the public about the science,” he says. “Many of the people who are being paid to conduct the science have been knowingly and intentionally manipulating their results, omitting results, selectively cherry picking and basically misrepresenting their own findings because they’re getting federal funding.” </p>


<p id="nRXKRr">Where did Godshall get the evidence that vaping is 99 percent safer than smoking? “Basically every study that’s ever been published,” he told me. </p>


<h1 id="i937Yu">Recycling Old Claims</h1>


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="n6pGAq">Long before scientists began studying vaping’s potential harms and benefits, distributors marketed e-cigarettes as a “healthier way to smoke.” Ads featuring scantily clad women claimed e-cigarettes could help smokers “<a href="http://www.keepsmokinganywhere.com/">stop the habit</a>” and get “<a href="http://www.safesmoke.us/oldfiles_alps/index.html">real nicotine</a> in a harmless water vapor that you can smoke...virtually anywhere!” Where smokers saw a new gadget to satisfy their nicotine cravings, the FDA saw companies peddling a drug with unsubstantiated health claims. And in the spring of 2009, the agency blocked imports of e-cigarettes <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/UCM173191.pdf">made by three Chinese manufacturers</a> as unapproved drug delivery devices.  </p>


<p id="lVQzbi">Smoking Everywhere, which imported and distributed the Chinese products, promptly <a href="http://www.fdalawblog.net/files/smoking-everywhere---complaint.pdf">sued the FDA</a>, tweaking the argument tobacco companies had made a decade earlier: e-cigarettes are not nicotine or drug delivery devices, but tobacco products and therefore outside the agency’s jurisdiction. E-cigarette distributor NJOY soon joined the lawsuit, and CASAA, Godshall, and several other vaping advocates later <a href="http://casaa.org/wp-content/uploads/amicus_brief_smokefree-7-8-2010.pdf">filed a supporting brief</a>. </p>


<p id="ZUcDph">Several months after seizing the products, the FDA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210112502/http://www.fda.gov:80/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm173222.htm">announced</a> that its scientists had detected tobacco-related carcinogens and toxic chemicals in some of the samples. The industry’s libertarian allies quickly rose to its defense. The American Council on Science and Health condemned the FDA for needlessly scaring the public, while Brad Rodu and Joel Nitzkin of the R Street Institute <a href="http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/162574365.html">cast doubt</a> on the agency’s science. Godshall for his part <a href="http://www.smokeversusvapor.com/fdareportsummary.htm">urged the FDA</a> to consider a test by e-cigarette manufacturer Ruyan, which he said found “no product hazards.” </p>


<p id="vzf1tq">Godshall also actively partnered with vaping companies. “I was the person who got the two owners of NJOY and Smoking Everywhere together and helped coordinate their legal team,” he told me. NJOY and Smoking Everywhere hired the same firms that helped the tobacco industry <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WnEj08tXa00J:https://www.law360.com/articles/316321/us-to-appeal-ruling-nixing-fda-s-cigarette-warning-labels+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">evade regulation</a> and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/865/665/1505802/">defeat smokers’ liability claims</a> for years. And their allies, including CASAA and Godshall, hired <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/865/665/1505802/">law firms that had successfully defended</a> tobacco companies Brown &amp; Williamson and Philip Morris against class action lawsuits brought by smokers seeking compensation from an industry they said lied about its products’ lethal nature. </p>


<p id="m99LjA">Bringing in veteran tobacco industry lawyers paid off. Nine months after Smoking Everywhere filed suit, a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00771/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00771-1.pdf">federal judge ordered the FDA</a> to stop seizing e-cigarette shipments. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="fjyfFJ"><q>“There is no smoke associated with e-cigarettes. So to call them smoking devices is ridiculous.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="qUC6rq">In the absence of federal oversight, state and city officials proposed their own measures to regulate vaping. In spring 2014, the Philadelphia City Council proposed adding e-cigarettes to indoor smoking laws and prohibiting their sale to minors. CASAA quickly issued a <a href="http://blog.casaa.org/2014/02/call-to-action-philadelphia-e-cigarette.html">call to action</a> and distributed talking points to help vapers oppose the measures. CASAA describes itself as a grassroots organization devoted to ensuring the availability of <a href="http://casaa.org/gallery-with-sidebar/">reduced harm alternatives to smoking</a>. Yet <a href="https://sharepoint.louisville.edu/sites/bcc/faculty/Faculty%20CV/Rodu%20CV.pdf">former</a> <a href="http://tobaccoharmreduction.org/thr2010alo.pdf">board</a> members have received research grants from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, British American Tobacco, US Smokeless Tobacco Company, and Swedish Match, which also makes smokeless tobacco. </p>


<p id="oZXSdX">Godshall, Gilbert Ross, then-executive director of the American Council on Science and Health, and R Street Institute’s Nitzkin also showed up to defend vaping. Defining e-cigarettes as smoking devices is “a major distortion of the truth,” <a href="http://legislation.phila.gov/transcripts/Public%20Hearings/health/2014/ph031314.pdf">Nitzkin told the city council</a>. Godshall urged the council to reject the bills, saying the vaping ban “deceitfully defines smoke-free e-cigarettes as electronic smoking.” Ross offered his own variation on the vaping isn’t smoking trope. “There is no smoke associated with e-cigarettes,” Ross said. “So to call them smoking devices is ridiculous.” </p>


<p id="BMqrat">Yet that’s exactly what the vaping companies and their supporters called e-cigarettes in their FDA lawsuit. Smoking Everywhere — as its name suggests — <a href="http://casaa.org/wp-content/uploads/SE-v-FDA-original-complaint-4-28-09.pdf">described itself as a</a> “corporation that has pioneered the marketing and importation of electronic smoking devices...marketed, labeled, and sold solely to provide adult consumers with alternative ‘smoking’ pleasure, without the inconveniences of traditional tobacco smoking.”</p>


<p id="xSpkQk">Godshall also resurrected the argument Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute used to ridicule the FDA’s first attempt to regulate nicotine as a drug. “So, I mean, why don’t you ban coffee?” Godshall asked. “It’s got carcinogens in it, toxic chemicals.”</p>


<p id="6VeVfD">The Philadelphia City Council, supported by the local health department, didn’t buy his argument. Both bills passed in a unanimous votes in March 2014, a month before the FDA finally proposed its “deeming” rule to regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products. </p>


<p id="VXWtjW">States have had less success than cities in passing e-cigarette legislation. In California, then-state Senator Ellen Corbett introduced a bill in 2013 to prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes in vending machines and regulate them like any other tobacco product. CASAA <a href="http://blog.casaa.org/2013/03/call-to-action-california-e-cigarette.html">again rallied its base</a> to fight the measure, arguing that e-cigarettes aren’t tobacco products, exactly the opposite of what the group claimed in a brief supporting Smoking Everywhere’s lawsuit. </p>


<p id="UzY0sM">In the past, cigarette companies had to create phony grassroots smokers’ rights groups to take their case to the public, says UCSF’s Stanton Glantz. “Now there are grassroots groups that popped up on their own that tobacco companies hide behind.” </p>


<p id="sa4DUw">And as vaping advocates fight regulations in public hearings, tobacco companies work the halls and back rooms of the capitol. Philip Morris, Reynolds American, and its allies paid lobbyists nearly $1.2 million over the 2013–14 election cycle to fight Corbett’s bill and other tobacco legislation, a review of campaign filings shows, while NJOY kicked in an additional $88,105. When the bill emerged from the Assembly Governmental Organization Committee — which tobacco control advocates call the “place where tobacco control bills go to die” — e-cigarettes were no longer defined as tobacco products. The bill died after many health advocates reluctantly withdrew their support.</p>


<p id="OCTKlB">Former California state Senator Mark Leno also tried to regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products in 2015. This time, the Northern California chapter of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association (SFATA) mobilized vapers. In opposing the bill, former Norcal SFATA director Stefan Didak told legislators he’s never taken money from the vaping or tobacco industry. He didn’t mention that SFATA’s board members included a former senior marketing executive for Philip Morris and a National Tobacco Company executive who claimed to have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265275/">shredded a million incriminating</a> documents for the tobacco industry in the 1990s and founded a company that makes synthetic nicotine. </p>


<p id="RWQhB8">Altria and its allies paid their lobbyists over $908,700 to fight Leno’s measure, while NJOY and SFATA spent $67,500. And again, the Governmental Organization Committee changed the bill’s language to say that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products. “The chair of the Assembly committee attempted to completely hijack our bill by creating a new definition of e-cigarettes, which was exactly what the tobacco industry wanted,” Leno told me. “We had to walk away from our own bill.”</p>


<p id="kDRdrz">The tobacco and vaping industries have spent nearly $10 million to fight regulations on e-cigarettes and related legislation in California since 2009, state records show. Altria and Reynolds American spent over $70 million in 2016 alone to fight taxes on tobacco and e-cigarettes in California. It took a special session called by Governor Jerry Brown to get around the Assembly Governmental Organization Committee. Leno reintroduced his original bill, which passed last year along with what health advocates call the most wide-reaching package of tobacco control legislation in decades. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="kJI800"><q>Recent research shows that e-cigarette users have more carcinogens in their urine than nonusers</q></aside></div>


<p id="58HyLW">The scope of tobacco industry spending to influence policy is no surprise to Samir Soneji, who’s well-versed in the industry’s tactics. He remains troubled that tobacco-control allies who once exposed the tobacco industry’s deceptions seem to accept the same actions by the e-cigarette industry. “It might be the same playbook but they don’t make that connection.”</p>


<p id="Xh1VAf">Even so, the summit made him think differently about the concerns of people whose lives and livelihoods are tied to vaping. It helped him understand why adult smokers who can’t quit despite repeated attempts are willing to try e-cigarettes before there’s conclusive evidence that they work. He’s even thinking of returning to the meeting next year so he can "rile up some more animosity,” he says, recalling the boos his last appearance provoked. He’s curious if anyone will change their view of vaping in light of new studies, which are “coming out constantly." Recent research shows that e-cigarette users have more carcinogens in their urine than nonusers, for example, in contrast to studies presented at the summit that “heavily discounted” their toxicity.</p>


<p id="5DFtBB">Vaping interests, meanwhile, continue to discount e-cigarettes’ harms as they’ve redoubled efforts to fight restrictions on the devices. After the FDA finalized its rule to regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products last year, vaping companies and their allies again tapped tobacco industry lawyers to fight the FDA. Nicopure, which makes e-liquids and e-cigarettes, hired the <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=knyw0128">same law firm</a> that ran Philip Morris’ Whitecoat operation to cast doubt on the dangers of secondhand smoke. The suit again challenged the agency’s jurisdiction and argued that the rule violated companies’ constitutional rights to free speech by preventing e-cigarette manufacturers from making truthful statements about its products. “Notwithstanding plaintiffs’ rhetoric,” a federal judge wrote in rejecting the claims in July, “this provision does not ban truthful statements about health benefits or reduced risks; it simply requires that they be substantiated.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="OhXRz8"><q> “Banning e-cigarettes would actually increase transportation-related deaths by driving nicotine-dependent passengers to drive rather than fly,” their opening brief argued</q></aside></div>


<p id="viywCc">The industry tried a more creative approach last year, when <a href="https://cei.org/litigation/cei-v-dot">CASAA and the Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> sued the Department of Transportation to overturn a rule extending the smoking ban on airplanes to e-cigarettes. “Banning e-cigarettes would actually increase transportation-related deaths by driving nicotine-dependent passengers to drive rather than fly,” their opening brief argued, “and would undermine rather than promote passenger comfort by subjecting passengers to nicotine withdrawal symptoms that are a common cause of “air rage.” A federal appeals court rejected their argument in July. </p>


<p id="Mlvcl0">Tobacco control advocates scored another win during the summer, when San Francisco passed an ordinance banning the sale of flavored tobacco products. Within weeks, a group called Let’s Be Real, heavily promoted by by SFATA’s Didak, launched a voter petition to repeal the ban. The <a href="https://cei.org/content/fears-aren%E2%80%99t-facts-e-cigarettes">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.rstreet.org/op-ed/vape-flavor-ban-threatens-san-franciscos-legacy-of-harm-reduction/">R Street</a>, and other tobacco industry allies also attacked the ban, which suggests that they fear other cities will follow suit. Let’s Be Real announced in August that it had collected far more than the required number of <a href="https://www.vapingpost.com/2017/08/03/petition-against-flavor-ban-submitted-to-authorities-in-sf/">signatures</a> to force a referendum on the flavor ban. </p>


<p id="KXULOB">Where things get real is on the bottom line. San Francisco’s strict campaign disclosure laws require petitioners to reveal their benefactors. And the first part of that disclosure offers voters plucky, grassroots appeal: “Paid for by Let’s Be Real San Francisco, A Coalition of Concerned Citizens Supporting Freedom of Choice, Adult Consumers, Community Leaders, and Neighborhood Small Businesses.”</p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="02i1rf">If that seems rosy, the punchline is somewhat more worrying: “with Major Funding by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.”</p>


<p id="M0NXnt"></p>


<p id="P0V7tf"><em><strong>Correction: </strong></em>Stefan Didak was incorrectly identified as the current Norcal director of SFATA. He has left SFATA and now helps lead NOTBlowingSmoke. In addition, the group Let’s Be Real was not headed by Didak, but heavily promoted by him.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="342VC9">Go fast. Turn left. Win.</p>


<p id="j6DaZX"> </p>


<p id="RtZpzK">For decades, you could boil NASCAR down to this simple set of rules. The ethos is so concise that it’s often the main source of derision for the sport. (“All they do is turn left,” you might cry.) But that simplicity is also the backbone that made NASCAR popular in the first place.</p>


<p id="qnq15W">That’s why it felt cataclysmic when, this past January, NASCAR changed how its races work. Each race is now split into three “stages,” and drivers win points toward the season championship by doing well in those stages. The cars still go fast, they still turn left, and being first at the end still matters. But this was a fundamental change that could rattle the thinning fan base.</p>


<p id="ovJtTc">The thing with NASCAR is that there’s no preseason. Any new ideas you want to test have to be tested in real time. And since the biggest race of the year is also the first, the Daytona 500 — the Great American Race, <em>the</em> race you want to win — became a sort of beta test for this bold new plan that will play out over the remaining 35 races of the 2017 season.</p>


<p id="S6SC0v">So I went to Daytona International Speedway to watch it all play out. As a longtime, but on and off, fan of NASCAR, I figured I’d either see something new and refreshing or at least feel the heat of Rome burning.</p>


<p id="RglmMT">What I didn’t expect to find was a sport careening toward a technological and philosophical revolution. NASCAR has <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2017/1/11/14054898/nascar-ratings-attendance-decline">arguably never been at a bigger crossroads</a>, with the divisive new format, and more access to advanced technology and data than ever before. The question now is which way to turn the wheel. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="o2WY6q">NASCAR’s announcement of the stages was <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2017/1/24/14366142/nascar-race-format-changes-2017-season">confusing</a> and not terribly well received by fans or the press. The first explainer video the series released <a href="https://twitter.com/nascar/status/823669757329162241?lang=en">required repeat viewings to comprehend</a>. Comments sections of articles <a href="http://www.racer.com/nascar/item/137807-nascar-announcement-on-2017-race-formats-set-for-monday">lit up</a>. "Abandon All Hope, Here Is How NASCAR Is Chopping Up The Daytona 500 Into ‘Stages’,” read <a href="http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/abandon-all-hope-here-is-how-nascar-is-chopping-up-the-1792170651">one <em>Jalopnik</em> headline</a>. </p>


<p id="SEkAYG">Some motorsports diehards, inside and outside the sport, were open minded. But the majority I spoke to before the race weren’t so kind. A Camping World Truck Series team member told me it was “crazy." An IndyCar driver told me the change felt “gimmicky.” One fan simply blew a raspberry with his lips in response.</p>


<p id="0l8Fyk">But there are logical reasons for chopping a NASCAR race into smaller chunks. NASCAR races — especially the ones at the superspeedways — could be long, boring affairs until the closing laps. Drivers tended to lay back early on, towing the line between not falling too far behind while trying to avoid the inevitable big wreck. </p>


<p id="2k8qLc">NASCAR’s new format makes this a less attractive strategy. Races now consist of two equally short stages followed by one longer stage at the end. The top 10 finishers in each stage are awarded points for the season championship, offering an incentive to be more competitive during what would normally be the most boring parts of the race. </p>


<div class="c-wide-block"><div id="elXj5s"><div><div></div></div></div></div>


<p id="O8nH3M">Across the race weekend, drivers, crew chiefs, and team owners were overwhelmingly positive about the change. That could just be their media training, but they could also just be immune to change; NASCAR spent the last decade <a href="http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/nascar-is-choking-on-its-constant-rule-changes-1791546423">changing so many rules</a> that it'd be surprising if people inside the sport weren’t able to embrace a big one like a new race format. At the very least, it doesn’t seem to have anyone running for the hills.</p>


<p id="6JTAw8">"If you look at any other sport, there’s quarters or segments. We haven’t created anything crazy, we’ve just created a couple of breaks that are known,” says Todd Gordon, the crew chief of the Roger Penske-owned 22 team. "And those breaks, I think, allow us to have more input as crew chiefs and crew members on the strategies that you play to get to those breaks. You can make sacrifices in one that costs you the next. I think there’s a lot of different strategies that you can play, and you’ll see teams on different strategies. And that, in essence, is going to make, I think, some pretty exciting racing.” </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="AlYDbL"><q>The new format means there’s always an ending in sight</q></aside></div>


<p id="doAKCX">NASCAR should hope so, because the series needs to find ways to halt its declining viewership. The average number of people watching a NASCAR race has slipped <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/long-in-victory-lane-nascar-hits-the-skids-1487686349">from around 9 million in the early 2000s to under 5 million</a> in recent years. Attendance at the tracks has plummeted, and from great heights. (Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee once sold out <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2016/07/01/nascar-declining-attendance-tv-ratings-fans-social-media/86573130/">its 160,000-seat track 55 times in a row</a> for NASCAR races.) As that drop happened, NASCAR recoiled. It became such a black eye on the sport that the series stopped giving out attendance estimates in 2012 — a move that was obvious to the fans who were still watching, because empty metal grandstands are hard to hide on TV. </p>


<p id="FeTPs4">The new stage format may pay off for new fans and young viewers. If you’re a casual fan of NASCAR, or someone new to the sport, it was easy to stop watching when you turned the race on at lap 28 of 400. But with the new stages, there’s always going to be an end in sight. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="s6FJRB">Walking out of the hotel on race day, I overheard Kami, the receptionist, talking about the stages to two race fans who were eating breakfast. “I’ll admit it, I’ve fallen asleep during races,” she explained. “But this is supposed to make it more surprising.” </p>


<p id="pUQ0zg">Kami was right. This being the first time that the stages were used, there was lots of uncertainty. “Let’s see” how these first 60 laps play out, car owner Roger Penske radioed to driver Joey Logano after he fired up his engine. Kurt Busch — the eventual Daytona 500 winner — was told the wrong number of laps remaining in the first stage by his team. The announcers for the Motor Racing Network, the main radio and at-track broadcast partner for NASCAR, made the same mistake during the race’s second stage. (Both mistakes were corrected in short order.)</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="yR3Igf"><q>“You just go out and run and hope that, when the race is over, they pull your number.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="PXgzaJ">Daytona International Speedway is a crazy place to try something new. The edges of the 2.5-mile ring of asphalt seem to rise above you no matter where you stand. It's a place where many drivers — Dale Earnhardt Sr. among them — have died. The track’s size and speed created unpredictable racing even before the format change. “You just go out and run and hope that, when the race is over, they pull your number,” seven-time Daytona 500 winner (and seven-time NASCAR series champion) Richard Petty told a small group of reporters before the green flag dropped. “That’s how wide open the race is.”</p>


<p id="1zXtbB">The new format succeeded at increasing the mid-race competition, but not without testing the limits of NASCAR’s three national series. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race on Friday, which was full of young drivers, was fraught with crashes and close calls during the parts of the race that are typically calm. The Xfinity Series, NASCAR’s version of AAA baseball, was similarly full of wrecks. Both races appeared to be affected, at least in part, by the ramped-up pressure to perform throughout as opposed to just at the end.</p>


<p id="B6eTNf">The Daytona 500 itself was not as messy, but it benefitted from the new stage racing format. The Toyota cars made an early pit stop in an attempt to run the race on a different strategy, and this set up a much clearer manufacturer battle against the Fords and Chevrolets than a single race typically generates. And in general, drivers treated the few laps before the conclusion of a stage like they would the end of a race. It made them take more risks, even if they were more calculated than those taken in the other two races. </p>


<div><aside id="eFuSUb"><q>Stage racing created surprises in all three races at Daytona</q></aside></div>


<p id="sGPSlQ">The stages, and the uncertainty and aggression that they bred, paved the way for three unexpected race winners: Kaz Grala became the youngest winner ever in NASCAR’s top three series when he took the checkered flag in the Trucks race. Ryan Reed’s Xfinity Series win was only his second ever. (His first? The 2015 race at Daytona.) And Kurt Busch won his first Daytona 500 in a nearly 20-year career.</p>

</div></div>


<p id="RG2QlJ">Parker Kilgerman says he became a believer in the new format after the first stage was completed in the Truck Series race on Friday night. Kligerman, 25, has driven in all of NASCAR’s top three series, is also an on-air presence for NBC’s NASCAR coverage, and has become <a href="http://nascar.nbcsports.com/author/pkligerman77/">something of an ombudsman for the sport</a> on NBCSports.com. </p>


<p id="2Uhp7D">"I know from my experience of running that race multiple times that most likely we would’ve been single file for the first 10 cars on the bottom” at the end of the race’s first stage, Kligerman tells me. Instead, the trucks were racing two-wide early on. </p>


<p id="8nByxv">Kilgerman points out that it wasn’t just more exciting, but the stages were creating new opportunities for some drivers. "What we saw coming to that first stage end was a driver in Brett Moffitt running up front in an under-sponsored truck that has only two races committed — Daytona and Atlanta — before that team has to figure out where their funding’s coming from,” he says. </p>


<p id="ApLCfN">The stages gave Moffitt a better chance at collecting championship points than he likely would have had at the end of a full race, Kligerman argues. “Here’s a guy who has two races that may make it possible for him to run the full season or not,” he says. “And he’s pushing as hard as he can because getting that stage win would have been a huge points gain and also a playoff point gain, and a mark in the cap of that team to say hey we won a stage.” (Moffitt crashed before the end of the first stage, though, and finished 22nd.)</p>


<p id="o9OznW">The reaction outside of the NASCAR organization has been much more mixed. <a href="http://motorsport.com">Motorsport.com</a> called it an “enigma,” and “peculiar,” but<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/analysis-how-the-addition-of-stages-affected-the-daytona-500-878723/"> ultimately thought it was an “exciting start to a new era.”</a> <em>Jalopnik’</em>s Stef Schrader was less kind, saying the short breaks between stages made her “<a href="http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/stage-breaks-in-nascar-make-me-feel-robbed-of-racing-1792765774">feel robbed of racing</a>.” Another <em>Jalopnik</em> writer, Alanis King, even <a href="http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/a-graphical-representation-of-how-confused-people-were-1792805569?rev=1488331854187&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_jalopnik_twitter&amp;utm_source=jalopnik_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">tried to read the jumps in the website’s traffic</a> during the race as a sign that fans were confused about how the stages worked. <em>NBC Sports</em> actually <a href="http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2017/02/28/upon-further-review-daytona-speedweeks-was-a-weeklong-wreckfest/">graphed out the number of cars involved in wrecks</a> across the week at Daytona, calling it one of the costliest ever. <em>Autoweek</em> was one of the few to tow the line of patience: "<a href="http://autoweek.com/article/nascar/opinion-keep-calm-and-give-nascar-updates-some-time">Keep calm and give NASCAR updates some time</a>,” Matt Weaver wrote of the “polarizing” race.  </p>


<p id="OG7vNU">One thing Daytona made clear is the series needs to get better at explaining why this change was made, and why it will make the races more exciting. The Fox broadcast, while heavy on specifics of the changes, often whiffed on communicating the broader point behind them. </p>


<p id="KARAyy">NASCAR also needs to come up with a much simpler way to explain how the sport now works to newbie fans. Fifteen years ago, you could sum up NASCAR in two short sentences: “Try to win every race. The better you finish, the more points you get towards the season championship.” Now? Well, there’s already a whole Reddit thread full of fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/5pr0gt/official_format_change_discussion_thread/">trying to solve this problem</a>.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="9pP2wZ">Out behind turn three at Daytona International Speedway is where you’d want to run to if and when the apocalypse happens. Parked there is an overly air conditioned truck that’s stuffed to the ceiling with lighting-fast Ethernet. It’s also the last thing standing if there’s a power outage — when the lights went out <a href="http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/11/7/phoenix-international-raceway-power-outage-in-city-truck-race-delayed.html">during the middle of the 2014 Truck race in Phoenix</a>, the Pro Trailer, as it’s known, was the only thing still up and running at the Arizona track.   </p>


<p id="Dni0Rf">The Pro Trailer is a hub for the internet used by the teams on pit road, the race replay system used by race control officials, and the fiber optics for the broadcast video feeds. But it’s also where a bulk of the race officiating happens. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="iHR52f"><q>NASCAR’s Pro Trailer is like a diner kitchen full of short-order cooks</q></aside></div>


<p id="yHI6g3">Eight officials pop down in this trailer on race day and, like short-order cooks slapping hamburgers together, are served up dozens of real-time videos of pit stops by an advanced computer vision system that they must monitor in 2X speed. </p>

<p id="rrgXOv">The system at work here was put together by a British company called Hawk-Eye Innovations. If you’ve ever watched a professional tennis match, they’re the people who developed the vision processing technology that can tell if a tennis ball stayed in or out of bounds.  </p>


<p id="5wChuJ">In 2014, NASCAR was trying to find new ways to keep its some-odd 40 officials on pit road safe — there’s only so much a fire suit and helmet can do when there are 3,400-pound cars coming at you at 55 miles per hour. So the series turned to Hawk-Eye and asked them to find a way to automate the process.</p>


<p id="vtjm4k">Now one of the first things that gets done when NASCAR rolls into a track ahead of a race is to make a three-dimensional model of pit road. Then, three engineers spend 10 hours setting up close to 50 cameras on the roof of the grandstands. After that, it’s three more hours calibrating the cameras, with the engineers making sure that what they see matches up with that 3D model.</p>


<p id="qVNx5l">With the model in place and the cameras watching, Hawk-Eye’s system breaks the 2D image into layers. It can tell the difference between a tire, the tire changer, and the car. The system has been trained on the rules, and so infractions are spotted even if the eight officials are busy with other pit stops.  </p>

<p id="dqHRCC">Say the jack man comes over the wall too quickly, a rule that NASCAR put in place to keep pit crews from standing in harm’s way while other cars are also trying to pit. But the officials are all already monitoring other pit stops. The automated system will still spot this and other infractions and sort them based on severity. It also assigns them at random in order to erase any human bias. In this case, the computer would move this pit stop video to the top of the queue for the next available official. </p>


<p id="QmdChJ">After the official reviews a stop, they hop on the radio to the race control tower to relay any infractions, log the information, and move onto the next pit stop. The system automatically generates a video clip that can be accessed by the broadcast, as well as the teams if they want to see what they got wrong.   </p>


<p id="99IGip">A handful of officials remain on pit road to monitor things the computer vision system can’t see, and they also serve as a connection to the teams. In other words, they often get to break or explain the bad news.</p>


<p id="k42Bqd">At the end of each race, the engineers spend four hours packing the cameras back up, and the truck drives off to the next event. “One of the beauties of using camera technology, it’s low impact,” says Stephen Dwyer, who is contracted by NASCAR to oversee the Pro Trailer’s pit road operation. “You’re not putting sensors on the car, you’re not trying to dig up the raceway. When you use cameras and you use vision processing, it’s unobtrusive.”</p>

<p id="3eb0N4">The pit road system has been in place since 2015, and NASCAR had to test it side by side with the old way of doing things during the final 10 races of 2014. That’s a curious thing about NASCAR. Aside from a few minor tests, very little happens in the two-month-long offseason. If you want to test new ideas — whether it’s a new race format, or a semi-automated pit road penalty system — you have to test them in real race environments. </p>


<p id="YQjoJ3">"All of our races are spectacles, so while we’re out here trying to get work down, we’re fighting with the crowds, we’re fighting with all the logistics of getting in and getting around the track,” says Stephen Byrd, NASCAR’s director of technology development. "There’s no dress rehearsal, there’s no do-overs. When the green flag flies, that’s your time to debug and test and troubleshoot and really see whether the last week’s worth of work paid off, or do you get to that point where you missed something and it puts you off another week."</p>


<p id="VVjEbI">Byrd would know, because he’s spent the last few years turning NASCAR’s technological partnership with Microsoft into something the series is getting real value from. Byrd’s team has worked with Microsoft to develop a small suite of Windows 10 apps that are modernizing how the cars are inspected as well as how the officials monitor and review races. They’re also laying the groundwork for a much bigger shift.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="Gj4l8I">There’s a parade before every NASCAR race, though it’s not one full of confetti and music. NASCAR teams slowly march around the pit area to different inspection points, where officials poke and prod to make sure the cars don’t violate any rules. Big metal templates are slapped onto the cars to make sure teams aren’t playing tricks with the aerodynamics. The cars get weighed. The engines are checked for modifications. It’s the slowest thing that happens on race weekend. </p>


<p id="KyA400">A surprising problem with this system, though, was these officials were still using pen and paper as recently as 2014. That paper stayed with the car through the inspection process, but after the race it never left the track. There was no archiving, no tracking. If one team was consistently trying to break a particular rule, it was up to the inspection officials to remember — a big fuzzy hole in an otherwise precise process, and one that often led to cries of favoritism or foul play.</p>

<p id="tCI5t8">This also caused chaos for the directors of each of NASCAR’s top series. They’re the ones in charge of making sure everything runs smoothly according to the gospel of the broadcast schedule. In the days of pen and paper, this meant the directors would spend precious time on the radio or running around the track trying to find answers about the status of inspections.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="Hkgwy2"><q>From pen and paper to a Surface tablet</q></aside></div>


<p id="roOhtO">The solution Byrd’s team and Microsoft came up with was a program called NASCAR Mobile Inspection. Instead of pen and paper, officials now log their inspections in this app using a Surface tablet. The series directors can access the app on any Windows 10 device, and it gives them everything from a snapshot view of the completed inspections to the ability to sort infractions by team, speedway, or type.</p>


<p id="JYAV9W">The app cut inspection times in half, according to Byrd. "Our job is not to sit back like the police and write citations all day, that does us no good,” he tells me. "We want to make sure we have fair competitively balanced racing, and that’s the purpose of going through the inspection process.” </p>

<p id="s4zTgV">Data, especially real-time data, is hard to come by in NASCAR. And that’s by design. The people in charge of NASCAR are willing to change a lot about NASCAR, but they’ve held a tight grip on the role that the human element plays in the racing.  </p>


<p id="Iwk69G">Byrd claims the success of the Mobile Inspection app warmed the series to adopting more technological advancements. “Taking paper and pen away from officials that have been doing that process for 50 years in our sport, those are car guys and girls out there, not techies,” he says. "I can’t understate the level of challenge that was to pull it off. But once we got through that, it just sent good shockwaves through all of competition that we have the right team, the right partner, the right approach to doing this.” </p>


<p id="uD3iqY">That sea change gave Byrd’s team the freedom to tackle a new problem this season: modernizing the race control system. On race weekend, NASCAR deals with gobs of data: there’s the dozens of HD camera feeds, a fiber optic timing and scoring system, all the historical data, and the Pro Trailer’s pit road system. These were all discrete parts that lacked cohesion, and so Byrd’s team again worked with Microsoft to funnel them all into one app.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="dBBONE"><q>The race management app is a NASCAR nerd’s dream</q></aside></div>


<p id="xjlXUh">The resulting Race Management app is a NASCAR nerd’s dream. It’s like an advanced version of what you would typically expect a sport’s mobile app to be. It shows live timing and scoring, features multiple broadcast video feeds, and it even pulls in those automatically generated pit stop videos from Stephen Dwyer and Hawk-Eye’s pit system. The app can be used to monitor a race in real time, but it also caches each race in the cloud so officials can review races at a later date. </p>


<p id="0INJuT">Race Management is something fans would appreciate, and that may happen one day. But it’s also a tool that teams would love to get their hands on, because right now NASCAR basically offers no real-time data during a race. (The cars don’t even tell drivers how much gas is left.) </p>


<p id="B5S4qz">When NASCAR switched to electronic fuel injection system, it allowed teams to measure things like throttle position, engine RPMs, and brake pressures, but to this day they can only download that data during practice or after a race. </p>


<p id="IkKa49">When the cars are flying around the track, though, teams basically have lap times, whatever the broadcast shows, and what the driver is telling them. “The driver is still our main source of information, he’s our onboard computer,” Trent Owens, crew chief for the 37 car, shouts to me in the garage over the roar of a neighboring engine. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="HCpfru">The driver might not have to serve as the computer for long, though. The Race Management and Mobile Inspection apps are proof that NASCAR has entered a new era when it comes to the ability to generate, process, and collect data. The cars themselves even now have digital dashboards, which show a little bit more data than was previously available (like oil temperatures), and are customizable to the driver’s liking.</p>


<p id="Xhj8F0">The result of these advancements is that everyone involved with the sport — from the series directors and executives all the way down to the crew chiefs and drivers — are now grappling with a more philosophical question: who should that data be available to?</p>


<div><aside id="yVmVKl"><q>Big data is ready for NASCAR. Is NASCAR ready for big data? </q></aside></div>


<p id="YlPeAX">Ask a crew chief like Owens, who is part of one of NASCAR's smaller teams, and he’ll tell you straight out that he wants access. “We want all we can get,” he says. "As crew chiefs, we can’t get enough information on our race vehicle.” </p>


<p id="IF1rXo">Byrd recognizes the power in the applications he’s helped create. But he’s hesitant about allowing too much access. “We don’t want to create an arms race to make technology the forefront of our cars on the track,” he says. "Believe me, there’s an enormous amount of technology that goes into those cars. But NASCAR’s a little bit different. We like the control to be in the drivers’ hands. We don’t want to create a bunch of self-driving cars around the track, we want to make sure there’s that real human element involved.”</p>


<p id="hpXcU9">Gordon, the 22’s crew chief, was more diplomatic. "I’m indifferent. I can see both sides. The engineer in me says I want all the data I can have to make my racecar better. But I think the less we know, the better off the racing is.” When I asked if he’d refuse the data if it was made available, though, he leveled with me. "Well no. If we’ve got it, we’ll use it,” he said. "If you give me all you’ve got, I’m going to use every bit I can.” </p>


<p id="MiESv9">Kligerman went one step further, warning NASCAR to stay in its lane. F1 is already the hyper-technical motorsport, he says, so NASCAR should own the niche of being the motorsport with the most human influence. "We know we could just open it up and just suddenly be flooded with technology on the cars, and suddenly be flooded with data, and the engineers would rejoice because it makes their jobs easier, and even some of the drivers it makes our jobs easier,” he says. “But I don’t think that’s where NASCAR wants to go. There's definitely a fine line between keeping the human the most important factor, and keeping it technologically current.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="MmDKfn">Away from the haulers and the pit boxes, fans seemed just as into the Daytona 500 as with any other NASCAR race. They oohed and aahed at the crashes. They cheered when Dale Earnhardt Jr. briefly took the lead, and they jeered Kyle Busch until he wrecked. If there was any hand-wringing over the new format, it didn’t feel like anything more than the usual bitching that comes with being a racing fan.</p>


<p id="xhYhYW">Modernizing the race format and the technology is important for NASCAR going forward, but they're far from the only things that's going to keep the sport moving. NASCAR is more dependent on its TV revenue than ever thanks to the decline in attendance, so the success of those relationships (and contracts) will dictate a lot about the sport’s future. (This is also why, for now, “just shorten the races” is a losing argument.)</p>


<p id="AlbKqd">NASCAR also needs to work harder on diversity. This was the case even before this year’s Daytona 500, where Monster Energy — the new series sponsor — brought back the practice of “<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/monster-energy-girls-pictures-daytona-500-nascar-fans-monster-energy">grid girls</a>,” an embarrassing vestige that should have been left back in the 20th century. </p>


<div class="c-float-right"><aside id="iPjxax"><q>NASCAR will never be what it once was, and that’s a good thing</q></aside></div>


<p id="rCrphj">The most immediate help to NASCAR might be how its drivers and their liberal use of social media like Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. Hell, Brad Keselowski even used to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/sports/autoracing/nascars-keselowski-gains-more-than-100000-twitter-followers-during-daytona-500.html">tweet from his car</a> (until <a href="http://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/8628824/brad-keselowski-tweet-car-anymore">NASCAR changed the rules</a>). The sport is full of young stars who love to share, and that alone could set it up for another big run. </p>


<p id="cWmDnV">This year’s Daytona 500 was a chance for the fans in attendance and the viewers at home to get a glimpse of the immediate future of NASCAR. After three hot days in Daytona, though, it’s clear that’s all it was — a glimpse. Like any beta test, there are still bugs to be worked out and problems to be troubleshooted before NASCAR can truly measure the impact of these new ideas. There’s a decent chance the 2017 season ends with just as much swirling uncertainty as ever. </p>


<p id="nMy5p6">NASCAR’s not my favorite motorsport, even if it’s the one I’ve watched the most over the years. But what I love about it, and what I think made it so popular, is that the length of the races combined with the simple structure of “go fast, turn left” forces the drivers to battle themselves in addition to their competitors. It’s as much a mental game as it is about speed or fantastic crashes. </p>


<p id="9bE0ku">The new NASCAR is not the NASCAR I grew up with, but I liked what I saw in Daytona. They’ve found ways to push the sport without removing that human element. Now it’s up to NASCAR to prove that this is the right way forward. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4pJhAW">On May 29th, 2009, Michelle Dugan and her family began the 600-mile trip from El Centro, California to the Bay Area, where she was set to attend her college orientation. They left late Friday evening, driving through the dusty Imperial Valley landscape and its endless fields of onions, spinach, and alfalfa. Then on to Highway 86, past the desolate shores of the Salton Sea, toward Michelle’s grandmother’s home in nearby Coachella, where they would spend the night before the next day’s long drive.</p>


<p id="MgToNI">But at around 9PM, Michelle’s mother received a call: Michelle’s younger sister, Marie, was suffering a severe asthma attack back home and had been rushed to the emergency room. Michelle’s mother hurried back to the hospital, leaving Michelle at her grandmother’s and telling her not to worry. </p>


<p id="W8yvZQ">It’s unclear what triggered Marie’s episode that day, but it was so severe that the nebulizer she used to inhale medication — sometimes five times a day — had no effect. Her airway constricted until she was no longer able to breathe and, choking on her saliva, she lost consciousness. Marie made it to the hospital with a faint pulse, but efforts to deliver CPR failed. Just after 11:30PM, Michelle received the call that Marie had died. She left for El Centro immediately. The drive back, she says, was the longest hour and a half of her life. </p>


<p id="OLM7gL">Michelle was shocked by her sister’s death — between the two of them, Marie was supposed to be the healthy one. It was Michelle who had been hospitalized for asthma since she was an infant. “Lung infections, bronchitis — everything,” she says. “You name it, I’ve had it.” Though she’s only 27, she’s been told she has the lungs of an 80-year-old; doctors have talked about listing her for a lung transplant. </p>

<p id="FB2VES">Asthma in Imperial County is rampant. More children are admitted to the emergency room here for asthma-related cases than anywhere else in the state; almost 1 in 5 children suffer from the condition. There’s a long list of reasons why the county is home to such staggering rates of asthma: the fine layer of dust that coats nearly every surface; the gentle mist of pesticide sprayed across acres of produce; the black towers of soot emanating from crop burns; emissions from cars stalled at the border; and fumes from the Mexican maquiladoras wafting over the border. Kicked up by the strong desert winds, microscopic particles from each of these sources fill the air. </p>

<p id="tBoHTD">There’s another source of pollution in the valley that poses a major risk, though it’s only starting to make itself felt: the Salton Sea. An enormous blue void at the north end of the Imperial Valley, the Salton Sea once attracted more visitors than Yosemite. But California’s largest lake is now mostly forgotten, and those who know of it don’t have flattering things to say: they’ll tell you about vast beaches where the sand is made of fish bones; about eerie, half-abandoned <em>Mad Max</em>-esque communities; and most of all, its noxious emissions. In 2012, the Salton Sea burped up a cloud of sulfurous odor so thick that residents in Los Angeles 150 miles away <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/us/salton-sea-is-blamed-for-southern-california-stench.html">were hit</a> by the nauseating smell of rotten eggs.</p>


<p id="Z3Yhkw">Though it’s been shrinking for decades, on January 1st, 2018, the Salton Sea entered a nosedive. Thanks to a water transfer agreement with San Diego, 40 percent less water will now flow into the sea. It will recede dramatically, and its already shallow surface level will drop 20 feet. By 2045, its waters will be five times as salty as the Pacific Ocean, killing whatever fish still live there and scattering the birds that feed on them. </p>


<p id="fJCt5D">Though we often think of lakes as permanent landmarks, global warming, irrigation, and our constant thirst <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/03/drying-lakes-climate-change-global-warming-drought/">threaten these resources</a> around the world. Terminal lakes like the Salton Sea, bodies of water that have no natural drain, are particularly vulnerable. Iran’s Lake Urmia — once the largest body of water in the Middle East — has shrunk by almost 90 percent over the last 30 years; Africa’s Lake Chad is also 90 percent smaller than it was in the 1960s; and Kazakhstan’s Aral Sea, once the fourth largest salt lake in the world, has practically been wiped off the map.</p>

<p id="kV1hvQ">When these lakes evaporate, they can upend industries and erase surrounding communities. For residents near the Salton Sea, the most pressing problem is the threat of toxic dust. The receding Salton Sea will reveal at least 75 square miles of playa, the lake bed that the water once hid. When that soil dries, it will begin to emit dust laced with industrial runoff from the surrounding farms: up to 100 tons of dust could blow off the playa daily. If it isn’t captured, that dust will push the area’s asthma crisis from bad to dire. The Salton Sea is a dust bomb that has already begun going off. </p>


<p id="jwu5Jo">Marie’s death shifted the course of Michelle’s life. She never made it to the Bay Area and today she lives in Coachella, where her day-to-day is constrained by the limitations of her asthma: she uses a nebulizer three times a day, and straps on a vibrating vest to shake the mucus from her lungs every morning and night. She spends as little time outside as possible, moving quickly between her home, car, and office. She’s terrified of leaving her two children behind. In turn, they are vigilant about her condition. Her daughter, who is named after Marie, runs to start the nebulizer the moment she sees her mother is out of breath. “For a six-year-old to do that, it’s really heartbreaking.”</p>


<p id="1wNUff">Michelle says she knows the sea is a threat to her, and everyone in her community. When the hot desert wind blows through the valley, through the date palms and up into Coachella, the sea’s stench is undeniable. “It smells like death,” she says.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="iDvMmi">Randy Brown became the first person to walk the perimeter of the Salton Sea after deciding that hiking through Death Valley wasn’t enough of a challenge. “Anybody can walk across Death Valley in the summer,” he tells me. The Salton Sea was another matter: a Death Valley walker had attempted something similar in 2005, but settled for walking the nearby highway. And for good reason.</p>


<p id="1qcJ5u">Temperatures around the Salton Sea can climb to over 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer — in 1902, the nearby town of Volcano set an all-time US heat record for the month of June: 129. Humidity from the evaporating sea can make the air feel closer to 150 degrees. The earth here is gassy and, combined with the massive bacterial colonies that live in the water, can create a suffocating potpourri. </p>


<p id="OGWxiQ">The sea’s northern shore is covered in deep banks of dead barnacle shells and pulverized fish carcasses. “The best I can describe it as is like trying to walk through snow,” Brown says. Other parts of the shore are covered in mud and silt so fine it resembles quicksand. Brown remembers his dad telling him stories of duck hunters dying here of exposure, sinking deeper into the mud as they struggled to pull themselves out. </p>

<p id="SCkr0c">Once, the Salton Sea was an oasis. It formed in 1905, when flood waters breached a nearby canal, sending the entire volume of the Colorado River into what was then a dry, ancient lake bed called the Salton Sink. It took two years to patch the break; in that time, a lake almost twice the size of Lake Tahoe had sprung to life. By the middle of the 20th century, developers had recast the accident as a miracle, dubbing the area “the Salton Riviera.” Palm trees were planted and marinas were built; President Eisenhower shot a round at the Salton City Golf Course and the Beach Boys docked their boat at the North Shore Beach and Yacht Club.  Completing the atomic era fantasy, dozens of pink flamingos took up residence at the sea — escapees from the San Diego Zoo or live attractions brought in by a nightclub owner, depending on who you ask. </p>


<p id="M4dH7V">Randy Brown was familiar with the sea from childhood. Growing up in the ‘70s, he and his family would make the 150-mile trek from Monrovia, California to the Salton Sea every summer weekend. The area was still booming then. “If we didn’t get there Friday night or early Friday afternoon, there would be no room at the beach,” he says. Stocked fish populations had exploded, and fishermen spent days angling for Gulf croaker, tilapia, and orangemouth corvina, a prized game fish that can grow to over 30 pounds. “We would come home with 80–100 fish every weekend,” Brown recalls. </p>


<p id="Y2PooX">Those fish attracted enormous flocks of ducks, grebes, and even bald eagles; 450 different bird species and subspecies have been spotted here. Eighty percent of the continental population of American white pelicans wintered at the sea, grateful to find refuge in a state that was in the process of ruthlessly paving over its wetlands.</p>

<p id="awNgGl"><em>A 1960s promotional video for the Salton Sea.</em></p>


<p id="Ca2GSy">But by the end of the ‘70s, it was apparent that something was deeply wrong. “One year we went and the beaches were covered in dead fish — it was a real oddity,” Brown says. Then it happened again the next year. Two freak tropical storms in the late ‘70s flooded the area, washing away investments that never returned. </p>


<p id="n3dZ3K">Like thousands of others, the Browns stopped coming, though Randy says that had less to do with the conditions at the sea: as a teenager, he “discovered girls, partying, and alcohol,” and lost interest in family vacations. His parents moved away into California’s high desert.</p>


<p id="cp5tUq">By the ‘80s and ‘90s, the sea was trapped in an intense cycle of ecological collapse. With only the rare desert rainstorm and salty, nutrient-rich farm runoff to feed it, the seawater grew more saline by the year. Large algae blooms starved the water of oxygen, causing fish to drown. Their decomposing bodies fed more algae, kickstarting the cycle all over again. In the summer of 1999, almost 8 million tilapia died <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/12/news/mn-65092">in a single day</a>, their silvery corpses spread along the shore in a band that measured three miles wide and 10 miles long. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="72j3Vj"><q>“They stood still while gulls tore into their flesh and began eating them on the spot.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="P5cA3G">In turn, the birds that relied on these fish suffered from botulism and other diseases. Just in 1996, 15–20 percent of the Western population of white pelicans died here. Reporting for the Smithsonian that year, Robert H. Boyle wrote that 150,000 eared grebes had also died, with the surviving population “so disoriented that they stood still while gulls tore into their flesh and began eating them on the spot.”</p>


<p id="kGx1XQ">As the sea decayed, so did vacation communities like Salton City, Desert Shores, and Bombay Beach. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TjGAWxL23c&amp;t=208s">A 2004 documentary</a> about the Salton Sea, narrated by John Waters, captured a cross-section of the residents who now populated these towns: retirees clinging to the dreams they’d bought into, refugees from Los Angeles looking for a cheaper existence away from urban violence, and offbeat recluses who were fond of the sea’s latest incarnation. “It’s the greatest sewer the world has ever seen,“ said one resident. “Leave it that way.”</p>

<p id="WH55l8">In 2003, the Imperial Valley and San Diego signed the largest agriculture-to-urban water transfer agreement in US history. The Valley would now be selling much of its water to thirsty communities along the California coast, at a handsome profit. That meant less water going to farms, and less runoff flowing into the sea. The agreement included an easement period which expired at the start of 2018. It was thought that 15 years would be more than enough time to develop a solution for the sea, and the dust beneath it. But no solution came. </p>


<p id="juAngI">An ambitious 2007 proposal to build a healthy lake inside of the dying lake was shelved because of its $8.9 billion price tag. The state balked at the cost of two more proposals in 2015, costing $3.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. More creative proposals to desalinate the sea or even pipe water from the Pacific Ocean or Mexico’s Sea of Cortez have gone nowhere.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="PZT5Nx"><q>“It was not quite dead, but it was dying.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="SaBExn">In 2014, Randy Brown traveled to the Salton Sea for the first time in decades. Instinctually, he returned to the beach where he’d spent so much of his childhood. He was taken aback by the sight. “It was not quite dead, but it was dying,” he says. Around the perimeter of the sea, establishments had been burned out, left vacant, or wiped from the landscape as if they’d never existed. Because of the high salinity, the fish populations had begun to collapse — it’s rumored the last corvina was caught here sometime in the mid-2000s — and fewer birds were coming, too. One flamingo still remained, though she would disappear soon after. The sea had receded 100 yards from where he remembered it.</p>


<p id="iqbq52">Over the course of six days in June 2015, Brown <a href="https://www.saltonseawalk.com/">completed the 116-mile walk</a>, becoming the first person to successfully circumnavigate the shore on foot. When I asked him what stunned him most about the experience, Brown kept coming back to the receding shoreline.</p>


<p id="7QaC4q">On one of his first training walks in 2014, he came across a speedboat halfway out of the water. It was black and orange, and emblazoned with the name “Godzilla.” He liked it so much he took a picture of it. As he did the final walk one year later, he passed Godzilla again and took another photo. But now, the boat was 50 yards from the water’s edge. In between was nothing but soft, dusty playa.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="z7kDHi">When the wind blows in the Imperial Valley, a faint haze of dust rises from the earth. You can taste it on your tongue. Harder gusts summon clouds that shroud the sun, blinding drivers and forcing residents indoors. The dust kicked up by 65 mph winds this April delayed camping at the Coachella music festival for days. The air in Imperial County <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-air-is-dark-and-asthma-is-deadly-along-the-mexico-border/">is some of the worst in the country</a>, a dense blend of ozone and particulate matter. In 2015, the air here failed to meet California’s daily safety standards for more than a third of the year. </p>


<p id="UawKO9">You only need to spend a few days in the Imperial Valley to see signs of the asthma epidemic. Many children are born asthmatic here; <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2017/11/06/near-salton-sea-many-young-children-suffer-asthma-study-finds/837857001/">a recent study</a> found that 30 percent of parents at a Calipatria elementary school said their children had been diagnosed with the condition. Three elderly women standing in front of their home in the town told me that even healthy children under the age of one should remain indoors. Cindy Aguilera, who’s lived in El Centro for 11 years, has six children ranging from ages nine to 18, all of whom have asthma. Her nine-year-old has been hospitalized over 100 times, once for 15 days. Humberto Lugo, who works for a nonprofit that focuses on economic and environmental justice called Comite Civico Del Valle (CCV), says that his 10-year-old son goes to baseball practice with a glove in one hand and an inhaler in the other. “It’s a way of life here.”</p>

<p id="OnrIpt">These communities have tried to adapt to the air pollution. The Respira Sano program, a joint effort between CCV and San Diego State University, sends health workers on home visits to consult families on how to best protect themselves. If you live by a crop field — as many here do — windows and doors should be kept shut, especially when the spraying starts. Parked cars should have their windows closed to keep particulate from settling in the upholstery. Even dogs and cats need to be kept inside to keep their fur from soaking up pollutants. </p>


<p id="v3ehs0">Above all, it’s important to minimize how much time children spend outside on bad days. CCV’s Lugo and his colleague Esther Bejarano drove me out to Meadows Union Elementary school, which takes part in the nonprofit’s School Flag Program. Meadows sits on the outskirts of El Centro, and is boxed in by three fields and a highway. Bejarano went to school here, and she says she and her sister would dance in the spray of crop dusters, pretending it was fairy dust. (Though she is asthma-free, Bejarano’s two sons have asthma, as do her mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two nephews.)</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="YDVoh9"><q>Schools then raise green, yellow, orange, or red flags</q></aside></div>


<p id="bBYoee">Using a network of 40 monitors developed by CCV and dispersed through the Valley, the school can see real-time readings on air quality throughout the region. Depending on conditions, schools then raise green, yellow, orange, or red flags. If a red flag is up, teachers and school administrators know to keep kids indoors. The school’s janitor told me that the number of orange and red days has gone up in recent years. </p>


<p id="eAy9pd">But educational programs like these are stopgap solutions — knowing risks doesn’t protect you from them. Saima Khan is a pediatrician and the associate medical director at Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo, a clinic for families with low incomes. She briefly left the Imperial Valley to treat patients in a private clinic in upscale Rancho Cucamonga just outside Los Angeles, but eventually came back, she says, because she felt a responsibility to attend to a population in greater need. That decision has come at a cost. </p>


<p id="h5FxYx">Both of Khan’s daughters have developed asthma and six years ago, Khan was diagnosed with it herself. She has a 15-month-old child, who she says is fine for now, though she pays close attention to his breathing. Her husband wants to leave the area; he has recently developed severe allergies and Khan says she can hear him wheezing. When I ask whether she feels the pressure to leave, she tells me she’s torn. “Why are you still here and making us all sick?” her family asks her.</p>

<p id="URHRXm">The option of leaving is a luxury few here can afford. <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/imperialcountycalifornia/PST045216">One in four</a> live in poverty in the Imperial Valley. As demand for housing in California continues to outstrip supply, middle and lower-income families are forced to move to less hospitable corners of the state. Many of the people I spoke with expressed a desire to leave, but almost none had the means of doing so.</p>


<p id="fPEh7F">I met Carolina Villa, another asthma patient in the Valley, in front of her old high school. Holtville High also participates in the School Flag Program, and on the day of my visit, I could see a green rectangle hoisted high up the flagpole. Villa tells me she was a former track star, and once ran a 5:54 mile before asthma and the general stresses of age slowed her down. “The reality of it is,” Villa says, “most people can’t afford to move out of where they live.” Leaving behind your community, and family, is hard. So instead, they learn to make do. “Kind of like those chameleons that change colors.”</p>


<p id="qpR6re">But ocean breezes help her asthma, and Villa says she’d like to live by the water one day. “I think about buying property by the beach,” she says with a raspy laugh. “Right by the Salton Sea. It’s the only beach I can afford.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="c18vfL">Dry lake beds are some of the largest sources of dust on the planet. It’s estimated that every year, the Sahara Desert exhales 28 million tons of nutrient-rich dust that travels across the Atlantic Ocean to fertilize the Amazon rainforest. That dust migration creates plumes so large they can be seen from space. But <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/1/1/014005">half of that dust</a> comes from less than 0.5 percent of the Sahara — the dusty lake bed of what was once Lake Chad.</p>


<p id="KwpF16">No matter what it’s made of, particulate matter poses a hazard to those with respiratory problems. But when it’s laced with a century’s worth of fertilizers and pesticides, as it is on the playa of the Salton Sea, it’s more dangerous. There is simply no way to make this dust safe. The best thing to do is keep it on the ground — or better yet, underwater. As drying lakes generate new and problematic dust sources, dust control has become a big industry. </p>


<p id="rFnL74">From the Salton Sea, I drove 300 miles through California’s high deserts to the edge of the Eastern Sierra mountains, home to the largest dust mitigation project in the world. On the standard Google Maps view, Owens Lake appears as a large, baby-blue body of water. Switch to satellite view, though, and you’ll see Owens Lake for what it really is: a discolored scab left behind by a lake that no longer exists.</p>

<p id="3vjpwn">Owens Lake was made famous by the story of its plunder: in the early 20th century, Los Angeles piped its water south to slake the thirst of its growing metropolis. The draining of Owens Lake crippled the surrounding communities, but it was nothing compared to the calamity that followed. Once the water left, dust rose from the lake bed at staggering volumes, with thick walls of soot traveling up Owens Valley for up to 60 miles. Residents hid indoors, unable to see homes on the other side of the street. </p>


<p id="5nRg2P">Phil Kiddoo, the air pollution control officer now in charge of Owens Lake, says that on some days the lake bed emitted more than 100 times more dust than the federal government considers safe, spewing 75,000 tons of particulate matter every year. In the second half of the 20th century, this sparsely visited corner of the Sierra mountains became the single largest source of dust in North America.</p>


<p id="RiTZXN">In 1997, Los Angeles <a href="https://www.inyowater.org/documents/reports/owens-valley-water-history-chronology/">finally agreed</a> to make amends by funding a massive dust suppression effort here. The 100 square miles of lake bed was divided by berms into roughly 75 cells, each one employing a slightly different dust mitigation technique: one cell might consist of a miles-long blanket of gravel, while another is planted with sprinklers, keeping the ground moist. A third cell might be covered by a shallow layer of hyper-saline, Pepto-Bismol-pink brine. These efforts have come at a significant price: the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has paid out $2 billion so far and continues to fund air quality monitoring and year-round management. If these efforts were to be paused for as little as two weeks, Kiddoo says, the area would begin to dry up again, and the dust would return. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Ek58SO"><q>Residents hid indoors, unable to see homes on the other side of the street</q></aside></div>


<p id="v9GGKS">It’s ugly and expensive, but it works. It’s estimated that the mitigation efforts now capture between 95 and 98 percent of the playa’s dust. Although a hard, 30 mph wind blew on the day of my visit, the air quality was no worse than what you’d find in Los Angeles. In fact, the air was brilliant: I could see clear across miles of lake bed, into Owens Valley, and off to the distant snow-capped peak of Mount Whitney.</p>


<p id="Pt3cFH">Kiddoo is proud of what he and his team do, but he also admits, “You don’t want to end up here if you don’t have to.” As we drove across Owens Lake’s shattered landscape, I asked him what advice he’d give to those at the Salton Sea. He sighed deeply.</p>


<p id="ixN42I">Before he worked in air control, he was an EMT. The experience taught him to triage injuries — weeding out the critically wounded from bellyachers. With the Salton Sea, Kiddoo says, “You’ve got a dying patient, and if you don’t act now, he’ll be dead.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="Q0ySAX">In March 2017, just nine months before the easement period expired, the state of California <a href="http://resources.ca.gov/docs/salton_sea/ssmp-10-year-plan/SSMP-Phase-I-10-YR-Plan-no-appendices.pdf">finally released a 10-year plan</a> to address the Salton Sea. As the sea shrinks, the plan envisions diverting the remaining farm runoff and mixing it with Salton Sea water to create shallow, dust-suppressing pools along the shores to sustain wildlife and vegetation. Elsewhere, the state will dig ridges into the earth to trap fugitive dust, similar to techniques employed at Owens Lake. Depending on who you ask, the plan is either a case of “too little too late,” or “better than nothing.” </p>


<p id="iWfWSk">For one, the plan doesn’t address the sea’s central body of water. It will continue to shrink and concentrate until it becomes almost barren. (One official suggested to me that the exposed earth could be used to build a solar power farm.) In addition, the plan only addresses the sea’s north and south ends; there are no dust suppression projects for the significantly longer eastern and western shorelines, home to the struggling seaside communities of Desert Shores, Salton City, and Bombay Beach. As the shoreline recedes by miles, these waterfront communities — replete with docks and marinas — will be left marooned. Though it’s estimated almost 60,000 acres of playa will be exposed over the next decade, the state only outlines dust mitigations for less than 30,000 of them.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="Tag3bc"><q> It will continue to shrink and concentrate until it becomes almost barren</q></aside></div>


<p id="rFn0TJ">After decades of empty promises, money is finally starting to come in for restoration efforts. The 10-year plan will cost almost $400 million, and 80 million of those dollars have already been appropriated; a ballot proposition passed in early June of 2018 <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/06/05/california-election-prop-68-headed-approval-initial-results-show/670089002/">allocated another $200 million</a>. A November water bond could deliver $200 million more. Those are big numbers, but they pale in comparison to water projects the state has agreed to fund elsewhere. </p>


<p id="YCN1lu">And as residents here know, a plan — even a funded one — is no guarantee of action. “We have a plan, we have money, there is additional money lined up, and we have a constituency — myself included — that is running out of patience,” California assemblyman Eduardo Garcia said at <a href="https://waterbond.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/short-summary.pdf">a recent hearing</a> established to address the continued delays. Though the plan was only introduced a year ago, state officials admit they are already running severely behind schedule. A recently published <a href="http://resources.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/SSMP-Summary-Implementation-Table-2018_6-4.pdf">progress report </a>indicated the state would miss its already modest 2018 goal of suppressing 500 acres, and only complete suppression on the 300 of 1300 acres planned for 2019.</p>

<p id="0oTbz6">One late afternoon, I traveled to the Red Hill Bay Restoration Project at the southern end of the sea. What was supposed to be a model for the rest of the sea has become mired in some of the complications and inertia that have plagued restoration efforts here from the beginning. Project lead Chris Schoneman gave me a tour of the area in his white Dodge Ram. After cresting a seawall now located hundreds of feet from the water, we made our way toward a boat launch that sits a third of a mile away from the shore.</p>


<p id="nKIQay">The Red Hill Bay Restoration Project will divert nutrient-rich water from the Alamo, mix it with hypersaline water pumped from the sea, and release it into a large, shallow pool to create habitat for migratory wildlife. Alongside the pool, Schoneman’s team tilled dry playa to suppress dust. But because of unforeseen construction challenges and fiscal constraints, Schoneman admits the project is now $380,000 over initial budget. Originally slated to open in early 2017, he hopes it’ll be done by the end of this year. </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="36n0K1"><q>Under the dust hid dirt the color of dried blood</q></aside></div>


<p id="qyzIDg">As we walked past the outcropping for which Red Hill Bay is named, Schoneman kicked at the small dunes of dust that had gathered at his feet. Under the dust hid dirt the color of dried blood.  </p>


<p id="uW1hrx">Unless wide-scale dust mitigation measures are put in place soon, the cost of the Salton Sea will continue to mount, both financially and in the health of the tens of thousands who live around the Imperial Valley.</p>


<p id="H8UjQ0">Back in Coachella, sitting in the home she shares with her parents, two children, and her brother, Michelle Dugan says that she thinks about leaving Coachella, and maybe California altogether, though it’s expensive to move with children and she would miss her family. She says she’d like to go to Montana. She’s never been there, but she’s heard the air is clean. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZIsLfa">For most of her life, Tammy Dobbs, who has cerebral palsy, relied on her family in Missouri for care. But in 2008, she moved to Arkansas, where she signed up for a state program that provided for a caretaker to give her the help she needed. </p>


<p id="OsKY4Y">There, under a Medicaid waiver program, assessors interviewed beneficiaries and decided how frequently the caretaker should visit. Dobbs’ needs were extensive. Her illness left her in a wheelchair and her hands stiffened. The most basic tasks of life — getting out of bed, going to the bathroom, bathing — required assistance, not to mention the trips to yard sales she treasured. The nurse assessing her situation allotted Dobbs 56 hours of home care visits per week, the maximum allowed under the program. </p>


<p id="wpjY0g">For years, she managed well. An aide arrived daily at 8AM, helped Dobbs out of bed, into the bathroom, and then made breakfast. She would return at lunch, then again in the evening for dinner and any household tasks that needed to be done, before helping Dobbs into bed. The final moments were especially important: wherever Dobbs was placed to sleep, she’d stay until the aide returned 11 hours later.   </p>


<p id="lW4vrD">Dobbs received regular reassessments of her needs, but they didn’t worry her. She wouldn’t be recovering, after all, so it didn’t seem likely that changes would be made to her care. </p>


<p id="axwrPa">When an assessor arrived in 2016 and went over her situation, it was a familiar process: how much help did she need to use the bathroom? What about eating? How was her emotional state? The woman typed notes into a computer and, when it was over, gave Dobbs a shocking verdict: her hours would be cut, to just 32 per week.  </p>

<p id="8A64iX">Dobbs says she went “ballistic” on the woman. She pleaded, explaining how that simply wasn’t enough, but neither of them, Dobbs says, seemed to quite understand what was happening. Dobbs’ situation hadn’t improved, but an invisible change had occurred. When the assessor entered Dobbs’ information into the computer, it ran through an algorithm that the state had recently approved, determining how many hours of help she would receive. </p>


<p id="Sl448l">Other people around the state were also struggling to understand the often drastic changes. As people in the program talked to each other, hundreds of them complained that their most important lifeline had been cut, and they were unable to understand why. </p>


<p id="zzMaPc">Algorithmic tools like the one Arkansas instituted in 2016 are everywhere from health care to law enforcement, altering lives in ways the people affected can usually only glimpse, if they know they’re being used at all. Even if the details of the algorithms are accessible, which isn’t always the case, they’re often beyond the understanding even of the people using them, raising questions about what transparency means in an automated age, and concerns about people’s ability to contest decisions made by machines. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="EKFzHu"><q>Dobbs wrote that institutionalization would be a “nightmare”</q></aside></div>


<p id="vD4bCa">Planning for the cut in care, Dobbs calculated what she could do without, choosing between trips to church or keeping the house clean. She had always dabbled in poetry, and later wrote a simple, seven-stanza piece called “Hour Dilemma,” directed toward the state. She wrote that institutionalization would be a “nightmare,” and asked the state “to return to the human based assessment.” </p>


<p id="T4z20T">The change left Dobbs in a situation she never thought she would be in, as the program she’d relied on for years fell out from below her. “I thought they would take care of me,” she says.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="jRm5kz">The algorithm that upended Dobbs’ life fits comfortably, when printed, on about 20 pages. Although it’s difficult to decipher without expert help, the algorithm computes about 60 descriptions, symptoms, and ailments — fever, weight loss, ventilator use — into categories, each one corresponding to a number of hours of home care.</p>


<p id="m3AOEl">Like many industries, health care has turned to automation for efficiency. The algorithm used in Arkansas is one of a family of tools, called “instruments,” that attempt to provide a snapshot of a person’s health in order to inform decisions about care everywhere from nursing homes to hospitals and prisons.</p>


<p id="ytMApD">The instrument used in Arkansas was designed by InterRAI, a nonprofit coalition of health researchers from around the world. Brant Fries, a University of Michigan professor in the school’s Department of Health Management and Policy who is now the president of InterRAI, started developing algorithms in the 1980s, originally for use in nursing homes. The instruments are licensed to software vendors for a “small royalty,” he says, and the users are asked to send data back to InterRAI. The group’s tools are used in health settings in nearly half of US states, as well as in several countries.</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="BwiCxc"><q>The US is inadequately prepared to care for a population that’s living longer</q></aside></div>


<p id="qaVJM0">In home care, the problem of allocating help is particularly acute. The United States is inadequately prepared to care for a population that’s living longer, and the situation has caused problems for both the people who need care and the aides themselves, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-09/americans-will-struggle-to-grow-old-at-home">some of whom say</a> they’re led into working unpaid hours. As needs increase, states have been prompted to look for new ways to contain costs and distribute what resources they have. </p>


<p id="A0s7rA">States have taken diverging routes to solve the problem, according to Vincent Mor, a Brown professor who studies health policy and is an InterRAI member. California, he says, has a sprawling, multilayered home care system, while some smaller states rely on personal assessments alone. Before using the algorithmic system, assessors in Arkansas had wide leeway to assign whatever hours they thought were necessary. In many states, “you meet eligibility requirements, a case manager or nurse or social worker will make an individualized plan for you,” Mor says. </p>


<p id="jrDpOb">Arkansas has said the previous, human-based system was ripe for favoritism and arbitrary decisions. “We knew there would be changes for some individuals because, again, this assessment is much more objective,” <a href="https://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/dhs-rule-change-threatens-disabled-care/Content?oid=10388695">a spokesperson told the <em>Arkansas Times</em></a> after the system was implemented. Aid recipients have pointed to a lack of evidence showing such bias in the state. Arkansas officials also say a substantial percentage of people had their hours raised, while recipients argue the state has also been unable to produce data on the scope of the changes in either direction. The Arkansas Department of Human Services, which administers the program, declined to answer any questions for this story, citing a lawsuit unfolding in state court.</p>

<p id="raYHJo">When similar health care systems have been automated, they have not always performed flawlessly, and their errors can be difficult to correct. The scholar Danielle Keats Citron <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=850020098089107069001025123085029120028037009079051031109072096074027029000108012026118058007012054120046020084067091110075099007085094078038066069113005113016090062093020078028004004030005003090107022109071127028085066095100099104076084121003085025&amp;EXT=pdf">cites</a> the example of Colorado, where coders placed more than 900 incorrect rules into its public benefits system in the mid-2000s, resulting in problems like pregnant women being denied Medicaid. Similar issues in California, Citron writes in a paper, led to “overpayments, underpayments, and improper terminations of public benefits,” as foster children were incorrectly denied Medicaid. Citron writes about the need for “technological due process” — the importance of both understanding what’s happening in automated systems and being given meaningful ways to challenge them. </p>


<p id="ikzeDV">Critics point out that, when designing these programs, incentives are not always aligned with easy interfaces and intelligible processes. Virginia Eubanks, the author of <em>Automating Inequality</em>, says many programs in the United States are “premised on the idea that their first job is diversion,” increasing barriers to services and at times making the process so difficult to navigate “that it just means that people who really need these services aren’t able to get them.” </p>


<p id="mHIalP">One of the most bizarre cases happened in Idaho, where the state made an attempt, like Arkansas, to institute an algorithm for allocating home care and community integration funds, but built it in-house. The state’s home care program calculated what it would cost to care for severely disabled people, then allotted funds to pay for help. But around 2011, when a new formula was instituted, those funds suddenly dropped precipitously for many people, by as much as 42 percent. When the people whose benefits were cut tried to determine how their benefits were determined, the state declined to disclose the formula it was using, saying that its math qualified as a trade secret.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="qhHfDB"><q>“It really, truly went wrong at every step of the process.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="Y2qfVB">In 2012, the local ACLU branch brought suit on behalf of the program’s beneficiaries, arguing that Idaho’s actions had deprived them of their rights to due process. In court, it was revealed that, when the state was building its tool, it relied on deeply flawed data, and threw away most of it immediately. Still, the state went ahead with the data that was left over. “It really, truly went wrong at every step of the process of developing this kind of formula,” ACLU of Idaho legal director Richard Eppink says. </p>


<p id="y693Bc">Most importantly, when Idaho’s system went haywire, it was impossible for the average person to understand or challenge. A court wrote that “the participants receive no explanation for the denial, have no written standards to refer to for guidance, and often have no family member, guardian, or paid assistance to help them.” The appeals process was difficult to navigate, and Eppink says it was “really meaningless” anyway, as the people who received appeals couldn’t understand the formula, either. They would look at the system and say, “It’s beyond my authority and my expertise to question the quality of this result.” </p>


<p id="xYAa8T">Idaho has since agreed to improve the tool and create a system that Eppink says will be more “transparent, understandable, and fair.” He says there might be an ideal formula out there that, when the right variables are entered, has gears that turn without friction, allocating assistance in the perfect way. But if the system is so complex that it’s impossible to make intelligible for the people it’s affecting, it’s not doing its job, Eppink argues. “You have to be able to understand what a machine did.” </p>

<p id="F6xipV">“That’s an argument,” Fries says. “I find that to be really strange.” He’s sympathetic to the people who had their hours cut in Arkansas. Whenever one of his systems is implemented, he says, he recommends that people under old programs be grandfathered in, or at least have their care adjusted gradually; the people in these programs are “not going to live that long, probably,” he says. He also suggests giving humans some room to adjust the results, and he acknowledges that moving rapidly from an “irrational” to a “rational” system, without properly explaining why, is painful. Arkansas officials, he says, didn’t listen to his advice. “What they did was, in my mind, really stupid,” he says. People who were used to a certain level of care were thrust into a new system, “and they screamed.”</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="FCOuz5"><q>“What they did was, in my mind, really stupid.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="ROfbOS">Fries says he knows the assessment process — having a person come in, give an interview, feed numbers into a machine, and having it spit out a determination — is not necessarily comfortable. But, he says, the system provides a way to allocate care that’s backed by studies. “You could argue everybody ought to get a lot more care out there,” he says, but an algorithm allows state officials to do what they can with the resources they have.</p>


<p id="jAMN7j">As for the transparency of the system, he agrees that the algorithm is impossible for most to easily understand, but says that it’s not a problem. “It’s not simple,” he says. “My washing machine isn’t simple.” But if you can capture complexity in more detail, Fries argues, this will ultimately serve the public better, and at some point, “you’re going to have to trust me that a bunch of smart people determined this is the smart way to do it.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="lDGcqD">Shortly after Arkansas started using the algorithm in 2016, Kevin De Liban, an attorney for Legal Aid of Arkansas, started to receive complaints. Someone said they were hospitalized because their care was cut. A slew of others wrote in about radical readjustments.  </p>


<p id="2UHcyc">De Liban first learned about the change from a program beneficiary named Bradley Ledgerwood. The Ledgerwood family lives in the tiny city of Cash, in the Northeast of the state. Bradley, the son, has cerebral palsy, but stays active, following basketball and Republican politics, and serving on the city council. </p>


<p id="0mDYqd">When Bradley was younger, his grandmother took care of him during the day, but as he got older and bigger, she couldn’t lift him, and the situation became untenable. Bradley’s parents debated what to do and eventually decided that his mother, Ann, would stay home to care for him. The decision meant a severe financial hit; Ann had a job doing appraisals for the county she would have to quit. But the Arkansas program gave them a path to recover some of those losses. The state would reimburse Ann a small hourly rate to compensate her for taking care of Bradley, with the number of reimbursable hours determined by an assessment of his care needs. </p>

<p id="cAqycI">When the state moved over to its new system, the Ledgerwood family’s hours were also substantially cut. Bradley had dealt with the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which administered the program, in a previous battle over a dispute on home care hours and reached out to De Liban, who agreed to look into it. </p>


<p id="y8hDhT">With Bradley and an elderly woman named Ethel Jacobs as the plaintiffs, Legal Aid filed a federal lawsuit in 2016, arguing that the state had instituted a new policy without properly notifying the people affected about the change. There was also no way to effectively challenge the system, as they couldn’t understand what information factored into the changes, De Liban argued. No one seemed able to answer basic questions about the process. “The nurses said, ‘It’s not me; it’s the computer,’” De Liban says.</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="4CRJlO"><q>“it’s not me; it’s the computer.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="JDF2sY">At the time, they knew it was some sort of new, computer-based system, but there was no mention of an algorithm; the math behind the change only came out after the lawsuit was filed. “It didn’t make any sense to me in the beginning,” De Liban says. When they dug into the system, they discovered more about how it works. Out of the lengthy list of items that assessors asked about, only about 60 factored into the home care algorithm. The algorithm scores the answers to those questions, and then sorts people into categories through a flowchart-like system. It turned out that a small number of variables could matter enormously: for some people, a difference between a score of a three instead of a four on any of a handful of items meant a cut of dozens of care hours a month. (Fries didn’t say this was wrong, but said, when dealing with these systems, “there are always people at the margin who are going to be problematic.”) </p>

<p id="Jp3HaX">De Liban started keeping a list of what he thought of as “algorithmic absurdities.” One variable in the assessment was foot problems. When an assessor visited a certain person, they wrote that the person didn’t have any problems — because they were an amputee. Over time, De Liban says, they discovered wildly different scores when the same people were assessed, despite being in the same condition. (Fries says studies suggest this rarely happens.) De Liban also says negative changes, like a person contracting pneumonia, could counterintuitively lead them to receive fewer help hours because the flowchart-like algorithm would place them in a different category. (Fries denied this, saying the algorithm accounts for it.) </p>


<p id="BLttcw">But from the state’s perspective, the most embarrassing moment in the dispute happened during questioning in court. Fries was called in to answer questions about the algorithm and patiently explained to De Liban how the system works. After some back-and-forth, De Liban offered a suggestion: “Would you be able to take somebody’s assessment report and then sort them into a category?” (He said later he wanted to understand what changes triggered the reduction from one year to the next.) </p>


<div><aside id="uCFqcv"><q>Somehow, the wrong calculation was being used</q></aside></div>


<p id="Zs9N7m">Fries said he could, although it would take a little time. He looked over the numbers for Ethel Jacobs. After a break, a lawyer for the state came back and sheepishly admitted to the court: there was a mistake. Somehow, the wrong calculation was being used. They said they would restore Jacobs’ hours. </p>


<p id="yjeIfG">“Of course we’re gratified that DHS has reported the error and certainly happy that it’s been found, but that almost proves the point of the case,” De Liban said in court. “There’s this immensely complex system around which no standards have been published, so that no one in their agency caught it until we initiated federal litigation and spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to get here today. That’s the problem.”</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="iOGlSK">It came out in the court case that the problem was with a third-party software vendor implementing the system, which mistakenly used a version of the algorithm that didn’t account for diabetes issues. There was also a separate problem with cerebral palsy, which wasn’t properly coded in the algorithm, and that caused incorrect calculations for hundreds of people, mostly lowering their hours. </p>


<p id="vAj39R">“As far as we knew, we were doing it the right way,” Douglas Zimmer, the president of the vendor, a company called the Center for Information Management, says about using the algorithm that did not include diabetes issues. New York also uses this version of the algorithm. He says the cerebral palsy coding problem was “an error on our part.” </p>


<p id="JDzi2a">“If states are using something so complex that they don’t understand it, how do we know that it’s working right?” De Liban says. “What if there’s errors?” </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="lZGhNu"><q>About 19 percent of beneficiaries were affected by the diabetes omission</q></aside></div>


<p id="gF1JDg">Fries later wrote in a report to the state that about 19 percent of all beneficiaries were negatively impacted by the diabetes omission. He told me that the swapped algorithms amounted to a “very, very marginal call,” and that, overall, it wasn’t unreasonable for the state to continue using the system that allotted fewer hours, as New York has decided to. In the report and with me, he said the diabetes change was not an “error,” although the report says the more widely used algorithm was a “slightly better” match for Arkansas. One item listed as a “pro” in the report: moving back to the original algorithm was “responsive to trial result,” as it would raise the plaintiffs’ hours close to their previous levels. It’s not clear whether the state has since started counting diabetes issues. As of December, an official said he believed they weren’t. The Department of Human Services declined to comment.</p>


<p id="tBYic4">But in internal emails seen by <em>The Verge</em>, Arkansas officials discussed the cerebral palsy coding error and the best course of action. On an email chain, the officials suggested that, since some of the people who had their hours reduced didn’t appeal the decision, they effectively waived their legal right to fight it. (“How is somebody supposed to appeal and determine there’s a problem with the software when DHS itself didn’t determine that?” De Liban says.) But after some discussion, one finally said, “We have now been effectively notified that there are individuals who did not receive the services that they actually needed, and compensating them for that shortcoming feels like the right thing to do.” It would also “place DHS on the right side of the story.” </p>


<div><aside id="wKg6kS"><q>“Compensating them for that shortcoming feels like the right thing to do.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="kSArm2">The judge in the federal court case ultimately ruled that the state had insufficiently implemented the program. The state also subsequently made changes to help people understand the system, including lists that showed exactly what items on their assessments changed from year to year. But De Liban says there was a larger issue: people weren’t given enough help in general. While the algorithm sets the proportions for care — one care level, for example, might be two or three times higher than another — it’s the state’s decision to decide how many hours to insert into the equation.</p>


<p id="forGYv">“How much is given is as much a political as a service administration issue,” Mor says.</p>


<p id="gUYHzb">Fries says there’s no best practice for alerting people about how an algorithm works. “It’s probably something we should do,” he said when I asked whether his group should find a way to communicate the system. “Yeah, I also should probably dust under my bed.” Afterward, he clarified that he thought it was the job of the people implementing the system.</p>

<p id="tOD3ir">De Liban says the process for people appealing their cuts has been effectively worthless for most. Out of 196 people who appealed a decision at one point before the ruling, only nine won, and most of those were Legal Aid clients fighting on procedural grounds. While it’s hard to know, De Liban says it’s very possible some had errors they weren’t aware of. </p>


<p id="akp9ia">Eubanks, the author of <em>Automating Inequality</em>, writes about the “digital poorhouse,” showing the ways automation can give a new sheen to long-standing mistreatment of the vulnerable. She told me there is a “natural trust” that computer-based systems will produce unbiased, neutral results. “I’m sure it is in some cases, but I can say with a fair amount of confidence it is not as descriptive or predictive as the advocates of these systems claim,” she says. </p>


<p id="cHxbuZ">Eubanks proposes a test for evaluating algorithms directed toward the poor, including asking whether the tool increases their agency and whether it would be acceptable to use with wealthier people. It doesn’t seem obvious that the Arkansas system would pass that test. In one sign officials have been disappointed with the system, they’ve said they will soon migrate to a new system and software provider, likely calculating hours in a different way, although it’s not clear exactly what that will mean for people in the program. </p>


<p id="Ij4b2Y">Dobbs has done well up until now. Her house sits off a winding road on a lakeside hill, dotted in winter with barren trees. When the sun sets in the afternoon, light pours in through the windows and catches the plant collection Dobbs manages with help from an aide. A scruffy, sweatered dog named Spike hopped around excitedly when I visited recently, as a fluffy cat jockeyed for attention. “Sometimes I like them better than humans,” Dobbs says. On the wall was a collection of <em>Duck Dynasty</em> memorabilia and a framed photo of her with Kenny Rogers from when she worked at the Missouri building then known as the Kenny Rogers United Cerebral Palsy Center. </p>

<p class="c-end-para" id="X7T8Pj">For the time being, she’s stuck in limbo. She’ll soon come up for another reassessment, and while it’s almost certain, based on what is known about the system, that she’ll be given a cut, it’s hard to say how severe it will be. She’s been through the process more than once now. Her hours were briefly restored after a judge ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor in the federal lawsuit, only for them to be cut again after the state changed its notification system to comply with the ruling and reimplemented the algorithm. As she went through an appeal, the Department of Human Services, De Liban says, quietly reinstated her hours again. This, he says, was right around the time the cerebral palsy issue was discovered. He says this may have been the reason it was dropped: to save face. But as many people grappling with the changes might understand, it’s hard to know for sure. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JozR2w">Brockhampton is not yet a household name, but it’s on its way.  </p>


<p id="9Jsoqi">The LA-based group — <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kb3av/meet-brockhampton-the-internets-first-boyband">dubbed</a> "the internet's first boy band" — has over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, a young fan base that preordered all 5,000 copies of their $50 boxed set (of physical CDs!) in a matter of hours, and a sophomore album that debuted at #57 on the Billboard 200, just two months after their first failed to scrape the bottom of the chart. Their upcoming <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2017/10/24/brockhampton-love-your-parents-tour-dates">Love Your Parents tour</a> hopscotches all over the US and Canada, including three sold-out nights at New York City’s 1,000-capacity Irving Plaza, and they’ve been picked up as the latest major project of Christian and Kelly Clancy, the husband-wife management duo who coordinated the rise of Odd Future. </p>


<p id="UDYwR4">They embody a set of contradictions that would have seemed impossible only five years ago: they’re dodging major labels; they plan to be pop stars. They don’t have two dimes to rub together; they’ve released 11 viral music videos in a year. Recently, in response to some frequent questions, founder <a href="http://leandred.tumblr.com/post/166591286808">Kevin Abstract tweeted</a>, "No we still haven't signed and everything comes from us and we make all of the art in our house with each other and kiss sometimes." They take turns rapping over beats they make in their bedrooms; they call themselves a boy band. </p>


<p id="53P0bF">It’s a huge understatement to say that this distinction is important to them. It's <em>the</em> distinction, and it's what gives an already interesting musical project a feeling of irresistible urgency. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="K5pK6O"><q>"One Direction died so Brockhampton could live."</q></aside></div>


<p id="14k9l6">So far this year, Brockhampton has self-released two albums of genre-swirling hip-hop. They put out their debut album <em>Saturation </em>in June, <em>Saturation II</em> in August, and the trilogy-ending <em>Saturation III</em> is out this Friday. (That’s a far wilder pace than even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/25/9200849/one-direction-hiatus-by-the-numbers">the most crushing</a> of boy band production schedules.) The songs are both party and political, some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TP2yv78yMk">sticky-sweet and adolescent</a> to the point where you actually <em>might</em> believe they’ve been recovered from a lost One Direction album — and with their every breath they’ve insisted on that title, “boy band.” Fair enough. They’re selling out major concert halls; they’re <a href="https://twitter.com/romilhemnani/status/921341713389518848">asking fans</a> to stop trying to follow their moms on Instagram. One of the most popular <a href="http://leandred.tumblr.com/post/165994048643">posts</a> in the group’s Tumblr tag is "One Direction died so Brockhampton could live."  </p>


<p id="qYTj5G">The 14-person group pieced together by Abstract includes rappers Ameer Vann, Merlyn Wood, Matt Champion, and Dom McLennon, as well as producers Russell Boring (who goes by Joba), Romil Hemnani, Ciarán McDonald (who goes by bearface.), Kiko Merley, and Jabari Manwa, webmaster and app designer Robert Ontenient, photographer Ashlan Grey, creative director Henock Sileshi (who goes by HK), and their 22-year-old manager Jon Nunes. They live together in a house in North Hollywood that they have dubbed — completely sincerely — the Factory. </p>


<p id="eZZ6Eg">Watching them kind of feels like waiting for the end of a magic trick, or, I guess, to find out what it might be possible to will into being with sheer effort, insistence, and really good tweets. Is it possible to just <em>decide</em> that you’re the new One Direction and make it so?</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lU18pk">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="t7k19T">Twenty-one-year-old rapper and singer Kevin Abstract (born Ian Simpson) met Vann, Champion, Wood, and Joba in high school in Texas, and the rest of the members in a Kanye West fan forum. In 2011, he <a href="http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=51240.0">posted</a> "Anybody wanna make a band?" and in 2014, the high school buddies originally called AliveSinceForever annexed a bunch of new contributors and rebranded as Brockhampton (the name of the street that Abstract grew up on). The group swelled to over 40 members at one point, before it was winnowed down — via "cuts” — to what it is now. They moved to Los Angeles together and gave themselves the nickname "Southside One Direction." While they worked on the first Brockhampton mixtape <em>All-American Trash</em>, Abstract released two buzzy self-released solo albums — <em>MTV1987 </em>in 2014 and <em>American Boyfriend</em> in 2016 — and used the traction to catapult an unwieldy group of friends and collaborators to the cusp of pop stardom.</p>


<div class="c-wide-block"><div id="Xnlsta"><div></div></div></div>


<p id="EfxPpo">When I travel to Los Angeles in late November, Brockhampton is on the last day of filming their first self-funded, feature-length movie, written by <em>The Fader</em> contributor Alex Russell. They’re making it to celebrate the end of the <em>Saturation </em>trilogy, and the narrative will somehow tie together the music videos they’ve released so far, but that is all the information I can get that isn’t an obvious lie. (e.g., “You know <em>Forrest Gump</em>? It’s that.”)</p>


<p id="96MnSq">Most of the residents are still asleep when I walk into a nondescript house on a quiet street in North Hollywood, identical to thousands of others except for large splotches of blue spray paint on the brick walkway. It's noon? Because of the movie, the house, which usually sleeps 15, has had 25 people in it for the previous two weeks. A single log is still smoking in the fireplace, and an old lemon is impaled on the grate. The orange jumpsuits the performing members of Brockhampton wore to Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw music festival <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcBw4Asuv3E">in October</a> are tangled up on the floor with takeout containers, boxes of fabric softener, tubes of tennis balls, and a rock glass full of pennies. </p>


<p id="72DTHu">One of the film’s extras is sitting on the futon, listening to me wonder aloud about a pile of hubcaps in the corner. "It could be a lot messier," he says sleepily. "If you think about it. With 25 people... accountability drops logarithmically." It takes me about a minute and a half to write down the word "logarithmically," which is fine, because that's how long it takes him to say it.</p>

<p id="uk1QoJ">Almost everyone is still in bed, getting out of bed, or crawling back from Starbucks, so I walk around and catalog the variety of boy smells: shitty incense, Old Spice, rotten milk, gym bag, campfire. The greatest hits. I also step on at least four pairs of Supreme underwear before the mail comes, an event that turns into a <em>major</em> event because today's mail includes some "sick" new knives and a prototype of the just-announced <em>Saturation </em>boxed set, their first physical release.</p>


<div class="c-float-right"><aside id="8TwBzc"><q>They materialize — chaotically, like a puppy soccer team</q></aside></div>


<p id="LiC6Pc">They materialize — chaotically, like a puppy soccer team — to unwrap the box as a single fumbling unit. They are careful, as much as is possible, considering they are pretty much a puppy soccer team. The boxed set represents the grand finale of a year's work: physical copies of the <em>Saturation </em>trilogy, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a disc of unreleased demos, and a poster. </p>


<p id="ul6q6p">It was designed by Sileshi, Brockhampton's 23-year-old creative director. He studied graphic design briefly in college in North Florida, met the other members of Brockhampton online, and volunteered in their private Facebook group to make the artwork for their early singles. He edited their first music video. He quit school. Then he "studied" Virgil Abloh, Kanye West's creative director, realized that was essentially the job he was doing, and <a href="http://www.henocksileshi.com/">picked up the title</a>. This is how it goes here: you do something a few times and you’re good at it, you get a pillow and a job. </p>


<p id="HSuMU8">Everyone takes a turn touching the boxed set and then touching Sileshi's shoulder, telling him he has done an amazing job. "This doesn't even look like an album," someone in the center of the huddle says. "I would expect an iPad to come out of this box." The huddle agrees, then splinters off to perform some classic start-of-the-day tasks, like painting your face blue or moving a bucket of blue paint out of the sink so that you can use the sink. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="czy7nc">Why is it <em>so </em>important to call Brockhampton a boy band? This is the one question every member answers eagerly, regardless of whether they are in the middle of eating or smoking or riding away from me on a bicycle. "Nobody would call us a boy band unless we called ourselves a boy band," 25-year-old rapper Dom McLennon insists, standing on the tiny front porch. "No one would say it for us. We have to make that space. Who knows, maybe 15, 20 years down the line, you see boy bands doing open mics, getting their chops. That'd be the coolest shit in the world to me."</p>


<p id="Pi830I">They have a growing, slippery fandom that’s a lot harder to define than those of boy bands past. In Viceland’s eight-part miniseries about the US tour they did in support of Abstract’s second album, he notes that the fanbase is diverse but mostly kids of color, aged 13 to 19, and often queer. Their Tumblr fanbase seems to fall mostly into that demographic, though many of the biggest fan blogs are run by young women in Australia or the UK. Their Reddit fanbase is harder to pinpoint, but the fixation on merch and branding makes the discussion read like young boys hanging out in a streetwear forum. Sileshi tells me that the subreddit is full of kids who are using the space to do exactly what Brockhampton did: "A lot of the posts are just like 'Oh, anybody can make music? Let's make music together.'" He spends a fair amount of time on Tumblr, too, and sits up when I mention that there are blogs simultaneously dedicated to One Direction <em>and </em>Brockhampton, or 5 Seconds of Summer and Brockhampton, or The 1975 and Brockhampton.</p>


<p id="T3J543">"I appreciate that they would split it. It's crazy that they would even care about us as much as they care about One Direction," Sileshi says. Then he half-mutters, "One Direction is popular as fuck."</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="FeulJr"><q>“We make pop music. What is pop music right now? It's hip-hop.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="r5Lor9">Twenty-one-year-old rapper Ameer Vann is on his second joint of the day when he agrees to be interviewed in his Crown Victoria, with the windows rolled up, with two dozen red-and-white long-stem roses rotting on the back seat. </p>


<p id="rv2zqB">"I don't look like Justin Timberlake, and I don't look like Harry Styles," he says, "But I would love to be them. We do the numbers, you know what I mean? We sell out shows. We make pop music. What is pop music right now? It's hip-hop." This speech, strung together from arguments he's obviously had to present many times before, lifts off, even as he takes breaks to let traffic from the nearby Burbank Airport cross overhead. </p>


<p id="YnFpPW">Not that I've ever been in the presence of a pop star before, but it's immediately obvious that this kid's going to be very good at being a pop star. He is either a fiend for attention or a compulsive flirt, neither in a way that particularly offends me. You could glean as much from the fact that he spends every music video Jekyll and Hyde-ing it — a magnetic six-foot physical comedian one moment and then a broody loner the next — and the way he raps in the single “BOYS”: “I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry.” </p>


<p id="CHSaaj">"We make pop music, so why is it so weird for us to be a boy band?" he asks. “I think people will start asking that question. Why is it okay for <em>this</em> group of people to be called a boy band and it draws no attention at all? But not <em>this</em> group of people, who are seemingly the same except for one thing, or a few things.” He turns and rolls his hands. "And those things are..." Then he laughs. “New Edition is a fucking boy band and Boyz II Men is a man band. Those are never mentioned. They're like 'R&amp;B soul groups,' not a boy band. But at the time, that was the popular music."</p>


<p id="Q5s1mH">He's right. But also, the term "boy band" has not really ever meant "a musical group made up of dudes," nor has it been much of a compliment. It's usually reserved as a somewhat derisive term for a group of polished and market-tested performers who don't play "real" instruments and are known more for choreography and matching outfits. To want it is a little odd. But to repurpose it for a group of rappers makes some snarky, pedantic sense, in that a frequent rockist, often racially motivated critique of hip-hop is its general lack of live instrumentation. There's one pain point NSYNC and Brockhampton strangely share. More to his argument, boy bands are generally accepted as shining examples of unimpeachable good looks, charm, and harmless desire, all things that Americans have dementedly limited notions of. In August, a statement by Abstract went viral <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinabstract/status/900866820160110592">on Twitter</a> and then again <a href="http://2k17rebirth.tumblr.com/post/164576724780/i-love-kevin-so-much-bye">on Tumblr</a>, insisting that Brockhampton is a boy band despite all the things its members are that boy bands traditionally haven't been: "We're not white and some of us rap and like dick and dye our hair."</p>


<p id="P65mn7">Twenty-three-year-old rapper Matt Champion — the Tumblr fandom's favorite GIF muse, possibly due to the elasticity of his face and his near-constant bedhead — puts it even more plainly. Leaning as far away from my iPhone microphone as possible, in a tuxedo, grinning with only half of his mouth: "It's just what we are. That's the reason. That's it."</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="2iKDe0">Brockhampton is the product of a should-have-seemed-more-likely combination of influences, a mashup of Odd Future and One Direction that looks surprising until you think about it for 20 seconds. They’ve succeeded at taking the best parts of two “unmanageable group of young dudes” phenomena, smashing them together, and leaving the extra stuff on the floor.</p>


<p id="pVFO7r">They’ve been co-signed by Odd Future co-founder Tyler, the Creator, and it's easy to rattle off a list of what they've borrowed from the <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2010/12/15/feature-lil-b-young-l-and-odd-future-are-the-teen-wolves-of-california-eating-raps-guts">infamous rap collective</a>: they wear skater shoes; they read <em>Hypebeast</em>; they spent the whole summer releasing one anarchic, DIY music video after another; they express themselves on Twitter with well-received, <a href="https://twitter.com/romilhemnani/status/934205897852715008">playful aggression</a>; they have a low-budget <a href="https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/american-boyband">TV series</a> affiliated with a hip brand. However, they'd thank you to remember that they are not Odd Future 2.0. Not because they don't respect their obvious predecessor — they all love, <em>love</em> Frank Ocean and the notion that a rapper can and should know how to skateboard — but because they’re so thoroughly serious about the boy band label that it’s just not the lineage they prefer to situate themselves in. </p>


<p id="SwjKAB">The video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpu0JZxDz-w">"HEAT"</a> has the same affable, boisterous spirit as a One Direction clip. The video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nDsnJH30fs">"SWEET"</a> is straight out of the modern boy band playbook, spotlighting each of the rappers in warm close-ups that have already been GIF-ed dozens of times over by the teens of Tumblr. Its meandering, unbroken shot and Abstract's letterman jacket also read as winks at The Social Experiment's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ooH8frBWg">"Sunday Candy"</a> video, which was filmed in one take to adhere to a shoestring budget, and, more importantly, it directly preceded Chance the Rapper's ascension to the world's first never-signed pop star.   </p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="vMlroW"><q>“It can't be 'Kill people, burn shit, fuck school' forever."</q></aside></div>


<p id="6ccNhT">They don’t believe they need a Simon Cowell or a draconian major label five-year strategy to be a boy band. And while Vann says he adored Odd Future as a kid — loved what they had to say about individuality and upending norms — he acknowledges that he didn't notice the violent misogyny or prevalence of homophobic slurs in their songs until years later, when the members of Odd Future started to realize and apologize for that themselves. "I didn't understand feminism. I didn't understand like, what was being programmed into me," he says, slowly. "It took years for me to grow and become more of an adult and more of a man... It can't be 'Kill people, burn shit, fuck school' forever." </p>


<p id="gyjmpz">Abstract’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RSQaVG7_QI">solo work</a> fixated on racism and homophobia in the Texas suburb he grew up in, and now that he’s directing all of Brockhampton’s music videos and laying out the road map for the group’s future, every member seems to agree that these can and should be central concerns for their collaborative output as well. "Whose society is this? Who delayed my first kiss?" asks Merlyn Wood on "CASH." "Why you always rap about bein' gay? 'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay," Abstract shouts to open "JUNKY," while Wood twirls behind him in a yellow sundress. </p>


<p id="ELP3v9">There's an <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1163/kevin-abstract-is-your-american-boyfriend">obvious hunger</a> for this kind of work, and an ever-widening community of Tumblr fans <a href="http://emperor-of-kings.tumblr.com/post/165219286111/frank-ocean-made-straight-men-sing-my-guy-pretty">write in appreciation every day</a>, notes like: "Frank Ocean made straight men sing 'my guy pretty like a girl' loud and proud. Kevin Abstract made them shout 'I just gave my nigga head.'" That’s their defining quality: a level of frankness that is neither truly aggressive nor entirely palatable. Too blunt for what we usually call a boy band, too sweet for anything else. </p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="XiAvgx">For the most involved shot of the day, several of the boys are pretending to steal a television — which they took from their living room wall before we left the house — from a guest cottage someone has rented on Airbnb. They’ve painted each other’s faces blue, with paint that is not precisely face paint, but that someone declares "washable." Everyone is asked to chill out, and stay off of the freshly seeded lawn, and take a photo with the Airbnb host because his nephew happens to have heard of Brockhampton. I am asked to stand behind a shed so I am not in the frame. </p>


<p id="jtOy1e">Hanging out behind a shed, I think about how the boy band branding works for Brockhampton, not just because of their diversity — and their fans' desire for representation — but because they belong to <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/04/29/attention-spans-of-millennials/">a generation of cultural omnivores</a>. They don’t <em>see</em> One Direction as uncool. Abstract wants to direct a music video for Harry Styles, an unbroken tracking shot of the pop star walking down a suburban street with a boom box on his shoulder. Though they have a Tupac poster in their living room, they make no effort to convince me of their knowledge of rap history. They’ve certainly made no effort to adhere to norms of any one genre, which is sort of a norm in itself for people their age. And this isn't to say Brockhampton's roster of Texas skater boys and Connecticut Kanye stans don't have taste. What I mean is that they don't like everything, but they give themselves permission to like anything. </p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="XqBsvP"><q>They’ve certainly made no effort to adhere to norms of any one genre, which is sort of a norm in itself for people their age</q></aside></div>


<p id="aicXpV">The DVDs on the coffee table are <em>The Big Lebowski</em> and <em>Me, Earl and the Dying Girl</em>. They spend downtime eating Welch's fruit snacks and talking about Pixar. Someone's always asking for the music to be turned up — an obscure grime rapper, Ayo &amp; Teo's viral hit "Rolex," Courtney Barnett, Vince Guaraldi's <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas </em>score. You have to see the beauty in letting people like whatever the hell they want, if you're going to be eager about the term "boy band." </p>


<p id="4PLL5s">In that light, it's baffling that their <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brockhampton-saturation/">first</a> <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brockhampton-saturation-ii/">two</a> <em>Pitchfork</em> reviews, which are ritually reviled by their Reddit fandom, accuse them of "prizing coolness" over all else. </p>


<p id="Ph7Mkg">They don't even especially care about their (respectable) <em>Pitchfork </em>scores, except for where the accompanying write-ups dip into judgment on individual members' character. (In <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brockhampton-saturation/">the first</a>, there’s a particularly cruel line about the cherry-picked Matt Champion lyric, “y’all bitches make my dick soft.”) When I accidentally wade into it during what was a pretty chill backyard conversation, Joba sits up straight and addresses me as if he's hoping he can, by proxy, address the <em>Pitchfork</em> reviewer directly: "You don't know Matt. You don't know Ian. You sure as fuck don't know who we are or how we work. You can have your opinion and I respect your opinion — it doesn't mean I agree with it — but if you're going to attack people I love, then we have a problem."</p>


<p id="OFiiO1">This is exactly how much affection they show each other 100 percent of the time.</p>

<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="7HiERu">This easy camaraderie goes a long way in explaining how they've managed to make three albums in under a year. </p>


<p id="BMk7oe">Later, producer Romil Hemnani shows off the studio in his bedroom, which consists of an Apollo audio interface, a microphone, two synths, some drums, and two guitars, with everything on wheels. He has to be able to set it up in under a minute, he explains, speaking with the clip and confidence of a cartoon character. "The moment you have an idea is so important. My mic cable is like 30 feet long so I can fly it over to you. There's magic energy in here all the time in this house." </p>


<p id="G7xbN2">He says most recording rooms are outdated; his prized possession is a MacBook Pro, and his favorite brand is Apple, because it represents the intersection of art and technology. "These are beautiful devices and they're very efficient. I want to make music that's very efficient, but it's still art." He spins around in a desk chair, picks up a toy version of a Tesla, acknowledges that he still feels like a kid who plays with toy cars. McLennon rushes in to point out all the production gear in his room next door, then runs out to catch a flight to Connecticut for Thanksgiving as Hemnani yells, "Bye, I love you!" </p>


<p id="dj82hL">This affection is the perfect fodder for the type of eager Tumblr fandom and shipping culture that sprung up around One Direction — only better, because they lean into it instead of away, and they don’t even bother to acknowledge this as different. Abstract <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinabstract/status/923575954122801153">tweeted</a> a photo of Hemnani in October with the caption "I wanna make out with him forever;" Merlyn Wood <a href="https://twitter.com/merlynwood/status/900741640779911168">tweeted</a> "My Tinder dry as hell, Ima start catfishing with Matt Champion pictures." In the one day I spend with them, I hear more compliments than I have heard in the last 10 years. </p>


<p id="8fPhoW">Hemnani has a poster of Brockhampton’s pink-haired production assistant Kevin Doan on his wall. "That's K-pop star Kevin Doan," he says. "He's a K-pop star." Sileshi calls Joba “beautiful;” McLennon says Ameer Vann should be a household name, on par with Tony the Tiger. It is probably not a challenge to work fast when you believe so aggressively in everyone around you. It is definitely not a challenge to have and keep fans when you don’t have to fake all the intra-band love they so badly want to see. </p>


<p id="s89SYe">Nobody really even seems to understand what I'm asking when I suggest that it must be difficult to collaborate with so many people on so much art and stay friends, or live in what looks like a frat house with 14 boys who met online and stay not-assholes. "We're all good kids," Sileshi says. "I guess maybe we just happened to be like that? I don't know."</p>


<p id="IkeurZ">"I've never been in a frat house," Champion says, staring at me blankly.</p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QbLNJY">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="n7lGA7">A newer member, photographer Ashlan Grey quit his job at Walmart a year and a half ago to join Brockhampton on a whim. "I quit, but I told everybody I got fired," he says. "It was less embarrassing than telling people I quit." I laugh at this, and he laughs, too, but does not elaborate. He met Abstract online and started out by helping Brockhampton with their Instagram. He didn't shoot the movie, but he learned about C100 and ALEXA cameras from the professional freelancers the group hired. "That shit's expensive. I wouldn't want to fuck it up, and that's a whole new territory," he says. "But I've been learning a lot from them. Like, so fucking much. I didn't go to film school like they did."</p>


<div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="M499aI"><q>“I’ve never been in a frat house.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="y2wJKw">His idols are Casey Niestat and Spike Jonze, and he's wearing a <em>Donnie Darko</em> sweatshirt. "When I first watched it, I lived in a trailer park and I wasn't in college. I didn't have a job. I didn't know a lot of people, so I would just watch it every night," he says. "I love how people don't think it makes sense at all, but it does make sense in a weird way." Though he says most of the inspiration for his photography comes from "random shit" he finds online, it's easy to see how the watercolor suburban daydream of that movie has seeped into his candid portraiture. He says Brockhampton doesn't really make sense either. "I always make the joke that we're all ugly, but we play it off like a boy band. It works. It's weird how it works, but it fucking works, so we just run with it." </p>

<p id="wKxJB4">They plan to run pretty far with it, training Grey and the rest of their ever-widening creative roster as they go. Abstract's broader plan involves turning Brockhampton into a media company called Question Everything. They use Empire for distribution, a company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ogdenpayne/2016/09/26/empire-the-digital-distribution-company-that-turned-music-streaming-pennies-into-profit/">founded in 2010</a> by former audio engineer Ghazi Shami and fairly well-known for its streaming era savvy and hands-off approach. It’s a half-step up from DIY sites like TuneCore or CD Baby. They argue that there’s nothing the formal industry can do for them that they haven’t already done for themselves, and better and faster. </p>


<p id="hVea4l">"Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to start a record label," Abstract says, riding slow loops around the house on his bike, wearing blue Dickies and a T-shirt with a vintage Apple logo on it. "I always wanted to make something that was bigger than me, that wasn't just one person." He’s planning on using Apple, Def Jam, and Paramount Pictures as stencils for a huge, multifaceted art house. </p>


<p id="4XhMGA">Abstract speaks in a near-whisper while I jog alongside his bike. He is obviously, painfully bored by every minute of the day that isn’t directly related to making something. "I just know I want to make as much stuff as possible while I can and while we have this house and while we have this opportunity and people are looking at us," he says, when I ask for a plan for the next two years. "Whatever's happening today probably won't be happening tomorrow." I can’t decide if the wistfulness in his voice stems from a reluctant knowledge that what he wants sounds impossible, or if it’s more like the sad, restless impatience of someone who has no doubt that his time is coming and is annoyed to find that it’s taking so long. </p>


<hr class="p-entry-hr" id="63YQuL">


<p class="p-dropcap has-dropcap" id="V6ZBuA">The last shot of the day is of Vann singing karaoke in a tuxedo, his arm in a sling. So we load up a caravan and drive 40 minutes to a bar in a plaza in Culver City. The plan is to shoot the scene quickly and then hang out and celebrate, but when we arrive, we're told it could be up to an hour before some amateur stand-up comedy acts are done. Abstract tells Vann he wants him to sing Billy the Kid's "Won't Be the Same," and insists over his protests, "Just feel it out. It's gonna be amazing, whatever you do." While they wait, they do what young men do — they loiter in the parking lot eating candy, kicking water bottles at each other, wandering in and out of the bar. The last stand-up act is a white guy in his 30s who does a bit about gentrification and says something I don't catch that makes Vann furious. When he gets onstage, he introduces the song by shouting, "This one goes out to all the gentrifiers."</p>


<div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"><aside id="t6Lq9c"><q>“I always wanted to make something that was bigger than me, that wasn’t just one person.”</q></aside></div>


<p id="4mwxe3">A group of men in polo shirts starts yelling at him, interrupting the shot so they have to start the song over. Then again, and then one more time. Vann gets angrier and more determined. His face gets a little crumbly. The room feels itchy to me; it’s not where I want to be and not where I want these boys to have to be. But somehow, he is still funny, joking between verses, "Why you got me up here singing this Dolly Parton song?" He doesn’t let up, and riffs instead. “This is a song by a beautiful white woman, and there are no lyrics about gentrification.” Abstract bounces from one corner of the stage to the other and back again without breaking eye contact with Vann, who happens to be his oldest friend. They get the best version of the shot they're going to get, and he tears out of the bar.</p>


<p id="zRlQgr">The party isn't over, but it feels over. It's been a 12-hour day. I'm pretty sure everyone's knuckles and knees are tingling from the same bizarro adrenaline rush. Later, I fall asleep in a cab thinking about a posse of dudes at least 10 years older than the kid they're screaming at. My drowsy fantasy is a little corny, but I don't think it's a reach: these men will spend dozens or hundreds of nights in the same bar next to a nail salon, and Brockhampton won't. That's pretty much it. </p>

<p id="c0dgyQ">McLennon and Vann insist that they're not personally ready to be famous, even after their eloquent speeches about what it would mean for them to be pop stars. Sileshi says they <em>are </em>ready. Wood says, "We better be." Champion says, "I have no idea." Boy band-famous is a different kind of famous, and condensing years of plodding upward trajectory into six months of vertical ascent is a dizzying way to make that transition. But none of them are afraid of it, exactly: when I ask them to name their fears, they name things like sea creatures, greed, mothers, and death. </p>


<p id="LTdKpv">Actually, <em>most</em> of them say death, which is simultaneously endearing, doofy, and rude to argue with. "All these things in the world are conspiring against my existence already," McLennon says. “So what scares me the most is my vessel being gone before I say everything I need to say." He dwells on that for less than a moment, moving on to talk about why he’s so excited for people to hear <em>Saturation III</em>. </p>


<p class="c-end-para" id="IwDLEf">“These are all my best friends and my favorite artists,” he says, smiling as if he just found out they exist. “We're giving y'all the best days of our lives right now. That's the truth. We’re sharing the best times of our lives with y’all in real time.”</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein and his former studio's board members have reached a tentative deal with some of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, US media report.</p>
<p>Lawyers said the settlement to resolve civil lawsuits and compensate alleged victims was worth about $44m (£34.7m). </p>
<p>Mr Weinstein denies sexually harassing or abusing over 75 women. </p>
<p>He will stand trial in New York in June on criminal charges brought by two women, including rape. </p>
<p>Adam Harris, a lawyer for the studio co-founder Bob Weinstein told a judge that "an economic agreement in principle" had been reached, the Associated Press news agency reports. </p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Who is Harvey Weinstein?</h2>
<p>The 67-year-old is one of Hollywood's most famous producers and has worked on a number of award-winning films, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist.</p>
<p>In total, the films he worked on have generated over 81 Oscars since 1999 and founded the Miramax entertainment company in the 1970s, which initially focused on art-house films. </p>
<p>In 2005, he split from Miramax and founded Weinstein Co, alongside his brother Bob. </p>
<p>In 2017, Quartz reported that Mr Weinstein had become so powerful in Hollywood that <a href="https://qz.com/1101213/harvey-weinstein-is-one-of-the-most-thanked-people-in-oscars-history/" class="story-body__link-external">he had been thanked as many times as God in Oscar acceptance speeches. </a></p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How did the scandal unfold? </h2>
<p>In October 2017, the New York Times published a story <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" class="story-body__link-external">detailing decades of allegations</a> of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. </p>
<p>Actresses Rose McGowan and Ms Judd were among the first women to come forward. </p>
<p>The accusations include forcing women to massage him and watch him naked. He also allegedly promised to help some women advance their careers in return for sexual favours.</p>
<p>The film producer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41520007" class="story-body__link">issued an apology</a> acknowledging he had "caused a lot of pain" - but denied allegations that he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. </p>
<p>The outcry against Mr Weinstein led to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment.</p>
<ul class="story-body__unordered-list"><li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-44045291" class="story-body__link">What has #MeToo actually changed?</a></li></ul>
<p>As the accusations mounted, his company Weinstein Co dismissed him and filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mr Weinstein is due to go on trial in New York on 3 June on five charges of sexually assaulting two women. If found guilty, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>

                    Festivals have been trying to tackle plastic waste for years - with Glastonbury installing recycling bins in 2008

<p class="story-body__introduction">The world's largest concert promoter, Live Nation, says it will eliminate single-use plastics at its venues and festivals by 2021.</p>
<p>In the UK, that means events like Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Latitude and Download will go plastic free.</p>
<p>It's part of a push to achieve zero waste at Live Nation's clubs, concert halls and venues by 2030.</p>
<p>The pledge comes after independent British festivals like Glastonbury and Bestival vowed to cut plastic waste.</p>
<p>Glastonbury has announced it will not sell single-use plastic water bottles this year, owing to concerns about their impact on the environment.</p>

<p>While Bestival, Boardmasters and Kendal Calling were among 61 festivals who signed up to the "<a href="https://aiforg.com/drastic-on-plastic/" class="story-body__link-external">drastic on plastic</a>" initiative last year, pledging to rid their sites of single-use plastic by 2021.</p>
<p>They have also called on retailers such as Argos and Tesco to stop marketing and selling tents as single-use items, saying abandoned tents account for 875 tonnes of plastic waste every summer.</p>
<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">

</ul>
<p>Awareness of the impact of plastic on the environment has grown exponentially over the last few years. </p>
<p>It's thought that more than eight million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, harming wildlife and entering the food chain.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48358002" class="story-body__link">the government announced new restrictions</a> on the sale of plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds, which will come into effect in England from April 2020.</p>

<p>Live Nation's commitment will affect about 20 UK festivals and more than 20 venues, which it manages through the Academy Music Group. </p>
<p>These include high-profile concert halls such as the Brixton Academy, King Tut's Wah-Wah Hut in Glasgow, the Manchester Apollo and Cardiff International Arena.</p>

</ul>
<p>Live Nation says it will start trialling plant-based water bottles across Europe in 2019.   </p>
<p>It has also launched a <a href="https://www.livenationentertainment.com/2019/05/live-nation-sets-sustainability-goals-for-concerts-and-live-events-as-part-of-ongoing-green-nation-program/" class="story-body__link-external">new set of sustainability goals</a>, including a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030; and a commitment to send zero waste to landfill by 2030.</p>
<p>"Hosting over 35,000 concerts and festivals each year, Live Nation has the opportunity and responsibility to provide our artists and fans with a live music experience that protects our planet," said Michael Rapino, president of Live Nation Entertainment. </p>
<p>"The adverse effects of climate change are undeniable, and we want to use our place on the world stage to be part of the solution. Together our concerts, venues, festivals, and offices around the world are setting new sustainability standards for live events."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Three more climbers have died on Mount Everest, taking the death toll to seven in a week - more than the total for the whole of last year.</p>
<p>The three died of exhaustion while descending on Thursday.</p>
<p>It comes amid traffic jams near the summit as record numbers make the ascent, despite calls to limit the number of climbing permits.</p>
<p>Nepal has issued 381 permits at $11,000 (£8,600) each for the spring climbing season at the world's highest peak. </p>
<p>Two Indian climbers - Kalpana Das, 52, and Nihal Bagwan, 27 - died while scaling back down the mountain on Thursday. </p>

<p>Local tour organiser Keshav Paudel told AFP news agency that Bagwan had been "stuck in the traffic for more than 12 hours and was exhausted".</p>
<p>A 65-year-old Austrian climber died on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. </p>
<p>An Indian and an American lost their lives on the mountain on Wednesday, while an Irish professor, Séamus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on 16 May. </p>
<p>Conditions this year have also been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. </p>
<p>Five people are known to have died on Everest and one in Lhotse in the spring season last year.</p>
<p>The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit.</p>
<p>The rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited.</p>
<p>Ben Fogle, the adventurer and television presenter who climbed the mountain last year, called for "London Marathon style lottery for climbing permits" in a Twitter post.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood, an abortion and healthcare provider, have sued Alabama over its ban on abortion.</p>
<p>The groups called the "extreme" law a "manmade public health emergency".</p>
<p>The ban, which offers no exceptions for rape or incest, was signed last week but has not taken effect.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion supporters expected legal challenges, and hope the appeals will reach the US Supreme Court and allow them to re-visit federal laws.</p>
<p>Randall Marshall, executive director of the Alabama ACLU, said: "Abortion remains - and will remain - safe and legal in Alabama. With this lawsuit, we are seeking a court order to make sure this law never takes effect."</p>

<p>The southern state's controversial abortion law has made national headlines for weeks. </p>
<p>Under Alabama's new ban, physicians who provide abortions could go to jail for up to 99 years, but a woman seeking the procedure would not be criminally liable. </p>
<p>The law allows exceptions only if the mother's life is seriously at risk or the foetus has a fatal complication.</p>

</ul>
<p>Alabama is one of several states to pass highly restrictive abortion laws this year - and dozens more have proposed similar bills in their legislatures.</p>
<p>On Friday, Missouri's governor signed into law a bill banning abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>
<p>The governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio - signed bills in recent months <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47940659" class="story-body__link">banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected</a>. </p>
<p>Currently, abortion is still allowed in the US thanks to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v Wade, which ruled that abortions are protected up until viability - the point at which a foetus is able to survive outside the womb, around the third trimester of a pregnancy.</p>

<p>These types of anti-abortion laws have been deemed unconstitutional in the past, but supporters are emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member Supreme Court a conservative majority.</p>
<p>As the Alabama bill's sponsor, state congresswoman Terri Collins <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/restrictive-abortion-law-weighs-on-alabama-republicans-who-struggle-with-lack-of-exceptions-for-rape-incest/2019/05/13/bec7b736-759e-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html?utm_term=.35a0d15d63e2" class="story-body__link-external">explained to the Washington Post</a>: "What I'm trying to do here is get this case in front of the Supreme Court so Roe v Wade can be overturned." </p>
<p>The top court earlier this year blocked abortion restrictions in Louisiana - but only by a narrow margin, and that case is slated for a review later this year.</p>

<p>And the issue remains divisive nationwide - a 2018 Gallup poll found 48% of US women identified as pro-choice and 47% as anti-abortion.</p>
<p>One of the plaintiffs in the complaint, Dr Yashica Robinson, said Alabama women "already have to overcome so much just to get to our doors and this law further shames them, punishes providers like myself and stigmatises essential healthcare".</p>
<p>The ACLU and Planned Parenthood statement notes that they have "never lost a challenge to an abortion restriction in Alabama".</p>
<p>Similar abortion restrictions have already been blocked by legal challenges in Kentucky. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are also filing challenges in Ohio and Georgia.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The SpaceX company has begun the roll-out of its orbiting broadband system.</p>
<p>A Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida late on Thursday, packed with 60 satellites capable of giving users on the ground high-speed connections to the internet.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Elon Musk's firm aims eventually to loft nearly 12,000 spacecraft for its "Starlink" network.</p>
<p>SpaceX is one of several commercial outfits with permission to fly an internet mega-constellation.</p>
<p>Others include the UK-based start-up OneWeb, which began its roll-out in February with six operational spacecraft.</p>

<p>Online retailer Amazon also has ambitions in this market. It's working on a 3,200-satellite proposal known as Project Kuiper. </p>
<p>All the concepts envisage flying spacecraft in a low-Earth orbit less than 2,000km above the planet. This will minimise the delay, or latency, in the internet connections.</p>

<p>Each satellite weighs 227kg, has multiple high-throughput antennas and a single solar array, the SpaceX CEO explained in a briefing last week.</p>
<p>The platforms are also equipped with electric propulsion - a system that expels electrically charged atoms of krypton to provide thrust. </p>
<p>The engine is needed to lift a Starlink from its drop-off altitude of 440km to its operational height of 550km. </p>
<p>The propulsion system will also act to maintain the satellite's correct position in the sky, and to bring it down at the end of its service life.</p>
<p>Mr Musk said the newly launched Starlinks were an iterative design and later platforms would have a higher specification, featuring for example inter-satellite links.</p>
<p>It was "one of the hardest engineering projects I've ever seen done," he said, and cautioned that much could go wrong in the early phases of the roll-out.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Is there room up there for all these satellites?</h2>
<p>There is increasing unease about the number of satellites that could be launched in the next few years - for many purposes, not just broadband delivery - and how this might potentially clog up the space environment. </p>
<p>To give context to what is about to happen - there are just 2,000 operational satellites in orbit today, <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database" class="story-body__link-external">according to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a>' database. SpaceX's ambitions alone, if fully realised, would dwarf this population. </p>
<p>The great fear is that congested orbital highways will result in collisions and the production of debris that then initiates further destructive encounters.</p>
<p>SpaceX said it intended to be a responsible actor and had given its satellites the ability themselves to track orbital debris and to autonomously avoid it. </p>
<p>What is more, it added, all the Starlinks were 95% constructed from components that would burn up rapidly on re-entry to the atmosphere when decommissioned - exceeding all current safety standards.</p>
<p>It will be some time before SpaceX can actually offer connections to the internet. </p>
<p>For that it must launch many more than the 60 spacecraft on Thursday's Falcon. </p>
<p>Six further rocket flights will have to take place before minor broadband coverage is achieved. A dozen launches are required for moderate coverage, says Mr Musk.</p>
<p>He hopes ultimately that revenue from the telecommunications network can fund some of his other ideas: "We think this is a key stepping stone on the way towards establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the Moon."</p>

<p class="sp-story-body__introduction">Lance Armstrong says he "wouldn't change a thing" about the doping that helped him win and then subsequently saw him stripped of seven Tour de France titles between 1999-2005.</p>
<p>The American was banned from cycling for life in 2012 before admitting to using performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>But the 47-year-old <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/05/23/lance-armstrong-next-stage/">told NBC Sports<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> he had "learned a lot" from his "mistakes".</p>

    <div class="bbccom_advert">

</div>
<p>"I don't learn all the lessons if I don't act that way," he added. </p>
<p>"We did what we had to do to win," Armstrong continued. "It wasn't legal, but I wouldn't change a thing - whether it's losing a bunch of money, or going from hero to zero."</p>
<p>Armstrong repeatedly denied doping allegations following his return from cancer until finally confessing during a television interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013.</p>
<p>In 2018, he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/43832785">agreed to pay</a> $5m (£3.5m) to the US government to settle a long-running lawsuit that could have cost him $100m (£71m) in damages.</p>
<p>He was accused of fraud by cheating while riding for the publicly funded US Postal Service team.</p>
<p>"It was a mistake, it led to a lot of other mistakes. It led to the most colossal meltdown in the history of sport. But I learned a lot," he said in a 30-minute interview with the <a class="sp-story-body__external-link" href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/05/23/lance-armstrong-next-stage-mike-tirico-interview/">American network NBCSN<i class="sp-story-body__external-link-icon gelicon gelicon--external" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> that will be broadcast next Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't change the way I acted. I mean I would, but this is a longer answer.</p>
<p>"Primarily, I wouldn't change the lessons that I've learned. I don't learn all the lessons if I don't act that way. </p>
<p>"I don't get investigated and sanctioned if I don't act the way I acted. If I just doped and didn't say a thing, none of that would have happened. None of it. I was begging for, I was asking for them to come after me. It was an easy target."</p>
<p>Armstrong reiterated that he knew doping was widespread in cycling at that time.</p>
<p>He added: "I knew there were going to be knives at this fight. Not just fists. I knew there would be knives.</p>
<p>"I had knives, and then one day, people start showing up with guns. That's when you say, do I either fly back to Plano, Texas, and not know what you're going to do? Or do you walk to the gun store? I walked to the gun store. I didn't want to go home.</p>
<p>"I don't want to make excuses for myself that everybody did it or we never could have won without it. Those are all true, but the buck stops with me. I'm the one who made the decision to do what I did. I didn't want to go home, man. I was going to stay."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A French judge has charged the president of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) football club, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, with corruption over Qatari bids to host the world athletics championships.</p>
<p>Judicial sources quoted by AFP news agency said the case focused on the championships held in 2017 and 2019.</p>
<p>Mr Khelaifi, who is also the boss of Qatari TV channel BeIn Sports, has been under investigation since March.</p>
<p>Two payments totalling $3.5m (£2.8m), made in 2011, are under scrutiny.</p>
<p>London won the bidding to host the championships in 2017, but Qatar is hosting this year's championships in September-October.</p>

    <div class="bbccom_advert">
        
    </div>
</div>
<p>It is alleged that the payments were made by Oryx Qatar Sports Investment to another firm run by the son of Lamine Diack, ex-president of the IAAF, the world athletics governing body.</p>
<p>French prosecutors allege Mr Khelaifi approved the payment, but his lawyers deny he was either a director or a shareholder at the time in 2011. They say he only had shares in the company between 2013 and 2016.</p>
<p>Lamine Diack, 85, was charged with corruption in March in relation to the case, while an arrest warrant has been issued for his Senegal-based son, Papa Massata Diack. Lamine Diack was IAAF chief in 1999-2015.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Allegations denied</h2>
<p>The French term "mis en examen" - meaning "charged" in English - does not automatically trigger a trial, but means that prosecutors strongly suspect wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a statement Mr Khelaifi's lawyers said the allegations were "inaccurate" and that he "had not validated any payment of any kind whatsoever" in relation to the allegations.</p>
<p>Another BeIn Sports executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, is also under investigation in France over the awarding of the 2017 championships. He is a PSG board member.</p>
<p>Mr Obaidly, quoted by his lawyer, called the allegations "utterly baseless and unsubstantiated" and said he would contest them.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47065393" class="story-body__link">Mr Khelaifi was elected to the executive committee of European football's governing body Uefa</a>. Uefa told the BBC it is "monitoring the situation".</p>
<p>In a statement, the IAAF said: "We continue to be available to the French prosecutor to share any information that may assist the investigation.</p>
<p>"However, we have not seen the specific indictments referred to by the media. The dates published in the media appear to coincide with the bidding timetable for the 2017 IAAF World Championships which were awarded to London.</p>
<p>"The 2019 World Championships bid process began in February 2014 with a decision in November 2014. Our rights holder for the region was, and still is, Abu Dhabi Media, who signed as a partner in January 2014."</p>
<p>A lawyer for Mr Khelaifi denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying the Oryx payments were fully transparent.</p>
<p>"Nasser Al-Khelaifi was neither a shareholder, nor a director of Oryx in 2011. He did not intervene either directly or indirectly in the candidature of Doha," he said.</p>
<p>PSG won the French Ligue 1 championship this season, but were knocked out of the Champions League by Manchester United.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Patients who have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain can safely take aspirin to cut their risk of future strokes and heart problems, according to a new study. </p>
<p>Aspirin thins the blood and so doctors have been cautious about giving it, fearing it could make bleeds worse. </p>
<p>But <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30840-2" class="story-body__link-external">The Lancet</a> research suggests it does not increase the risk of new brain bleeds, and may even lower it. </p>
<p>Experts say the "strong indication" needs confirming with more research.</p>
<p>Only take daily aspirin if your doctor recommends it, they advise.</p>
<div id="bbccom_mpu_1_2_3" class="bbccom_slot mpu-ad" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="bbccom_advert">

</div>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Aspirin benefits and risks</h2>
<p>Aspirin is best known as a painkiller and is sometimes also taken to help bring down a fever. </p>
<p>But daily low-dose (75mg) aspirin is used to make the blood less sticky and can help to prevent heart attacks and stroke.</p>
<p>Most strokes are caused by clots in the blood vessels of the brain but some are caused by bleeds.</p>
<p>Because aspirin thins the blood, it can sometimes make the patient bleed more easily.</p>
<p>And aspirin isn't safe for everyone. </p>
<p>It can also cause indigestion and, more rarely, lead to stomach ulcers. </p>
<p>Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16 (unless their doctor prescribes it). </p>
<p>It can make children more likely to develop a very rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome (which can cause liver and brain damage).</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">The study</h2>
<p>The research involved 537 people from across the UK who had had a brain bleed while taking anti-platelet medicines, to stop blood clotting, including aspirin, dipyridamole or another drug called clopidogrel. </p>
<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item">Half of the patients were chosen at random to continue on their medicine (following a short pause immediately after their brain bleed), while the other half were told to stop taking it </li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">Over the five years of the study, 12 of those who kept taking the tablets suffered a brain bleed, compared with 23 of those who stopped</li>
</ul>
<p>The work is being presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference in Milan.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What do experts say?</h2>
<p>The research cannot prove that aspirin prevents future strokes but it appears to be linked to a lower risk. </p>
<p>Nor does it suggest that aspirin is always safe to take. </p>
<p>But it hints that more patients - those with haemorrhagic or brain bleed strokes - might benefit from daily treatment.</p>
<p>It's not clear if the study findings will apply to all patients in real life. </p>
<p>Lead researcher, Prof Rutsam Salman, from the University of Edinburgh, said: "At the moment, people do not know what the right thing to do is. </p>
<p>"Doctors are hesitant about giving aspirin or aspirin-like drugs to people who have had this type of stroke. </p>
<p>"UK and European guidelines do not give any recommendation, because there hasn't been enough evidence.</p>
<p>"I think we have now confirmed safety with these findings.</p>
<p>"It certainly seems that aspirin is safe enough to give."</p>
<p>Prof Salman recommended more work to see if aspirin might actually lower the risk of brain bleeds as well as clots. </p>
<p>Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: "Around a third of people who suffer a brain haemorrhage, also known as haemorrhagic stroke, do so when they are taking an anti-platelet medicine, such as aspirin, to reduce the risk of a heart attack or an ischaemic [blood clot] stroke. </p>
<p>"We now have a strong indication they can carry on taking these potentially life-saving medicines after the brain haemorrhage without increasing the risk of another one, which is crucial new information for both patients and doctors."</p>
<p>Anyone with concerns should speak to a doctor before considering changing medication, however. </p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Preventing a stroke</h2>
<p>You can reduce your risk by:</p>
<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item">eating a healthy diet</li>
<li class="story-body__list-item">taking regular exercise</li>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A sizeable oil slick developed in waters where tankers were damaged off the United Arab Emirates on 12 May.</p>
<p>Finnish company Iceye says one of its radar satellites detected a long trail leading from the Saudi-flagged vessel Amjad two days later.</p>
<p>The crude oil tanker and three other ships suffered damage while anchored outside the port of Fujairah.  </p>
<p>No-one has yet said they were behind the incidents. Nor is it clear precisely what happened.</p>
<p>US investigators reportedly believe <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48264499" class="story-body__link">Iran or groups it supports used explosives to damage the ships</a> - but no evidence has emerged to show that Iran was involved. </p>

<p>The analysis cannot state how much oil was present on the water, but the interpretation has been validated by Kongsberg Satellite Services, a Norwegian company with expertise in oil slick detection.</p>
<p>"Oil on top of seawater is visible on radar satellite imaging because it changes the way the water surface reflects radio waves," explained Iceye CEO Rafal Modrzewski.</p>
<p>"Oil forms a layer on top of the seawater. This changes the water's viscosity, flattening and making the surface smoother. As a result, oil on water appears on the image as a dark patch," he told BBC News.</p>
<p>The Amjad was reported to be empty of crude so the leak could well be engine fuel.</p>

<p>UAE and Saudi authorities have released few details about what happened on 12 May and an inquiry is under way.</p>
<p>The Reuters news agency reported that damage was inflicted on the Amjad; another Saudi tanker, Al Marzoqah; a UAE-flagged bunker vessel, A Michel; and a Norwegian tanker, Andrea Victory.</p>
<p>The event occurred amid rising tensions in the region.</p>
<p>Fujairah port is located on the east coast of the UAE in the Gulf of Oman and is at the funnel point into the Strait of Hormuz - the main shipping route linking Middle East oil producers with the rest of the world. </p>
<p>At any one time, many tens of ships will be anchored a few nautical miles from the port, either waiting to enter the Strait or stopping off before departing to destinations in Asia, Europe, the Americas and beyond.</p>

<p>Iceye released the X2 image on Thursday as a demonstration of its spacecraft's capability. The start-up's satellite design is significantly smaller and cheaper to produce than traditional radar spacecraft.</p>
<p>Iceye already has two suitcase-sized satellites in orbit and plans a large constellation to obtain rapid, repeat imagery of the Earth.</p>
<p>Radar's great advantage is that it sees the surface of the planet under all circumstances,  during the day or night and in all weathers. Radar satellites can therefore see and sense things that will often be invisible to other Earth observers, such as imagers that view the planet at wavelengths of light similar to our eyes.</p>
<p>"Iceye is launching (another) five satellites in 2019. Naturally, the exact timelines can always change depending on launch providers. New satellites are planned to be up in orbit already within a few months," Mr Modrzewski said. </p>
<p>Both the Fujairah emirate government and the ship owner have been asked for comment.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A school head embroiled in a row with parents over LGBT issues has vowed to "never stop" teaching pupils about equality.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters have gathered once more outside Anderton Park Primary School in Birmingham as demonstrations reached their eighth week. </p>
<p>Pupils were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-48382358" class="story-body__link">sent home early</a> before the biggest crowd yet arrived at the gates.</p>
<p>The protests' organiser, Shakeel Afsar, said action would continue after next week's half-term break.</p>
<p>Those against the inclusion of LGBT issues in classes have said the content contradicts their Islamic beliefs, and have accused the school of not listening to parents' concerns.</p>

<p>Head teacher Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson described the protests as "horrific" and said that learning about equality was "crucial".</p>

<p>"It's not peaceful, it's aggressive, it's rude, it shouts accusations at me, at the governors. </p>
<p>"They use a megaphone - this is a cul-de-sac, there's no traffic noise to get over. It's really unpleasant, it's really aggressive, it's sour and it's sinister."</p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">'Our children, our choice'</h2>
<p>The row over the inclusion of LGBT and transgender issues at primary schools in Birmingham began earlier this year. </p>
<p>Protests started outside Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock before spreading to Anderton.</p>

<p>Friday's protest is thought to be the largest yet, with those from the local Muslim community as well as LGBT campaigners arriving to have their say.</p>
<p>Outside the school, protesters chanted "our children, our choice", "let kids be kids", and "head teacher, step down". Parents waved banners, including one that said "don't class us as homophobic".</p>
<p>Parents complained books that demonstrated homosexual relationships should not be shown to children as young as five.</p>
<p>Ansar Ashraf, who has three children at the school aged between five and nine, said the school was not listening to parents' concerns. </p>
<p>"We are protesting for them to hear us, that we have a right about what should be taught," he said.</p>
<p>"We are not homophobic or discriminating in any way, we just think there should be an age category."</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">A nine-year-old boy has died after becoming trapped underneath a locker at a school in Essex.</p>
<p>It happened at an after-school swimming club at Great Baddow High School in Chelmsford on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Leo Latifi, who was not a pupil at the school, was taken to hospital where he later died.</p>
<p>The head teacher of St Michael's Primary School paid tribute to her Year 4 pupil, who she said was a "sparkle in our school".</p>
<p>Essex Police said Leo was with family members when he fell from a locker and got trapped.</p>

<p>Maria Rumsey, head teacher at St Michael's, said staff, parents, governors and pupils were "shocked and immensely saddened" by Leo's death.</p>
<p>She said: "He will be greatly missed by all. We wish to extend our thoughts and condolences to all of Leo's family and friends at this saddest of times. </p>
<p>"Leo was a sparkle in our school. His face lit up the classroom and his mischievous blue eyes made us all smile.  </p>
<p>"He was an avid scientist, who only on Wednesday was in his element hunting for bugs on the school field. </p>
<p>"Leo was always keen to share his model-building and wowed the class when he brought in the finished masterpieces. He had a wide circle of friends in the year group, all of whom will miss him greatly."</p>
<p>She added the school would be supporting staff and pupils as they came to terms with the loss.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Thirty people taking part in a yoga session have been arrested during a private class in Iran, reports suggest, causing a buzz across the country's social media.</p>
<p>They were detained at a private residence in the northern city of Gorgan, where they were apparently taking part in a mixed class.</p>
<p>Local justice department official Massoud Soleimani said the instructor, who was also arrested, had no licence to run the class and had advertised the event on Instagram. </p>
<p>He also said that those taking part were wearing "inappropriate outfits" and had "behaved inappropriately", <a href="https://bit.ly/30Hu73K" class="story-body__link-external">the Tasnim news agency reports</a>.</p>
<p>The Islamic establishment in Iran does not allow any mixed-gender sports activities. </p>
<p>Professional-level yoga teaching is also banned in the country. </p>
<p>Mr Soleimani, the deputy chief of the Islamic Revolution Court in Gorgan which is the capital of Golestan Province, did not give any more details about the attire or behaviour of the detained group.</p>
<p>He did say that security forces had been monitoring the residence for some time before making the arrests.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Cancelled classes</h2>
<p>The story, which was <a href="https://bit.ly/2EvZ814" class="story-body__link-external">also reported by the Young Journalists Club,</a> has caused a stir online and has become a top trending topic in social discussions.</p>
<p>"They [Iranian authorities] think even the word yoga is problematic based on the Sharia," one user tweeted. </p>
<p>"An establishment that finds even yoga harmful does not need the USS Abraham Lincoln warship to end its existence," another tweeter added, referring to the recent deployment of US warships to the region. </p>
<p>Others say they have cancelled their plans to sign up to yoga classes following the arrests in Gorgan.        </p>
<p>"I guess the authorities need to tell us what exactly we are allowed to do in this country," commented another tweeter.</p>
<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-40245830" class="story-body__link">Iranian sports authorities issued a ban on Colombian dance aerobics exercise zumba</a> and "any harmonious movement or body-shaking instruction".</p>
<ul class="story-body__unordered-list">
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-middle-east-40880420" class="story-body__link">Iran arrests six for zumba dancing </a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/world-middle-east-44777677" class="story-body__link">'I risked everything to dance in Iran'</a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36101150" class="story-body__link">Who are Islamic 'morality police'?</a></li>
<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/blogs-trending-42612546" class="story-body__link">How do Iranians defy the internet censors?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Back then Iran's Sport for All Federation penned a letter to Iran's Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports to ban activities, including zumba, for contravening "Islamic ideology".</p>
<p>While there have have been public gatherings of yoga fans in the country over the past few years, "underground" and "unIslamic" classes, which are promoted across social media, are frowned upon.</p>
<p>While revealing the arrests, Mr Soleimani also criticised the "lack of surveillance of activities" on social media in the country.</p>
<p>Twitter is officially banned in the country. However, there does appear to be an increased surveillance of Instagram by Iran's authorities, especially more recently.</p>
<p>This week the social media accounts of at least three street musicians were apparently seized by Iranian authorities for publishing "criminal content", <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-48366149" class="story-body__link">while singer Negar Moazzam is currently under investigation</a> after performing for a group of tourists in the country's Isfahan Province. </p>
<p>Her Instagram account is no longer public.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has apologised after a teacher alleged her group of pupils suffered racist language and treatment during a visit. </p>
<p>Marvelyne Lamy said staff had followed the black and other minority 12 and 13-year-olds, yelling at them not to touch exhibits while ignoring white groups.</p>
<p>She said staff told the group: "No food, no drink, and no watermelon."</p>
<p>The term dates back to the US civil war and is considered derogatory when used in relation to the black community.</p>

</ul>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What happened during the trip?</h2>
<p>Ms Lamy, an English teacher at the Davis Leadership Academy in Boston, complained about the "racial profiling" of her class of black and minority pupils in a Facebook post. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marvelyne.lamy/posts/10158516060369676?__tn__=-R" class="story-body__link-external">It has been shared more than 1,000 times</a>.</p>
<p>"We were instructed not to touch any of the artefacts in the museum, yet the white students there touched the displays several times while security looked on without saying anything," she said. </p>
<p>"The minute one of our students followed suit, the security guards would yell at them that they should not touch exhibits."</p>
<p>Her students became agitated because of this treatment and she gathered them to leave as a result, she said.</p>
<p>Visitors at the museum also made racist and derogatory remarks about the pupils, Ms Lamy said.</p>
<p>"The worse part about all of this is seeing the hurt look on my children's faces as this was their first time experiencing racism first hand," she said. </p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">How has the museum responded?</h2>
<p>In an open letter, <a href="https://www.mfa.org/about/open-letter-from-mfa-leadership-team?fbclid=IwAR1ex4Xot2UPW439CrlQ_0s4DlkegNm83It74MhihnmH010JMOkzhcGAmOg" class="story-body__link-external">the museum apologised</a> and said Ms Lamy and her pupils had "encountered a range of challenging and unacceptable experiences that made them feel unwelcome".</p>
<p>The museum said it was investigating the incident and was "committed to being a place where all people trust that they will feel safe and treated with respect", they said.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Why is 'watermelon' a racist term in the US?</h2>
<p>When slavery was abolished at the end of the 1860s some black people grew and sold watermelon to provide for their families.</p>
<p>The fruit went on to be used as an excuse to characterise an entire section of the population as being lazy and content with simple pleasures and, therefore, flaunting their independence. </p>
<p>Minstrel shows, caricatures, songs and cartoons were used to used to dehumanise and denigrate the black community. </p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/01/boston-herald-apologizes-for-obama-watermelon-toothpaste-cartoon/" class="story-body__link-external">The Boston Herald was forced to apologise</a> for a cartoon after an intruder broke into the White House during Barack Obama's presidency. The cartoon showed a man sitting in the bathtub referring to "watermelon flavoured toothpaste".</p>
<p>In another separate incident in 2014 <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/22/us/coach-fired-watermelon-ritual-irpt/" class="story-body__link-external">an American football coach in South Carolina was first fired and then re-instated</a> for allowing players to smash a watermelon while making ape-like noises in a post game celebration.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The chief executive of Thames Water has stepped down after failing to turn around the performance of one of the UK's largest utility companies.</p>
<p>Steve Robertson will be replaced with immediate effect.</p>
<p>A source close to the company said the firm wanted someone with "a mind for operations".</p>
<p>Thames Water, which manages water supplies and waste water, has struggled with leaks, falling profits and increasing customer complaints.</p>
<p>The firm said that Mr Robertson, who was appointed chief executive in September 2016, had "successfully transformed" the firm "in a challenging environment" but that he was leaving by mutual agreement.</p>

<li class="story-body__list-item"><a href="/news/business-47918253" class="story-body__link">Water firm outlines 'nationalisation refund'</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But Thames Water has been criticised for not being able to bring the number of leaks under control. </p>
<p>In December the firm said last spring's cold weather had caused pipes to burst, while the summer heatwave had brought supply problems. </p>
<p>Since 2017, Thames Water has been fined more than £128m for poor management of leaks.</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-45395914" class="story-body__link">it announced fresh investment in infrastructure</a> as part of a £11.7bn five-year plan.</p>
<p>Thames Water said under Mr Robertson's tenure it had "increased its focus on customer satisfaction, improved incident response capabilities, expanded support for vulnerable families and invested more than £2bn in the network to improve overall performance".</p>

<p>Ian Marchant, interim executive chairman, who will lead the company while a permanent replacement is found said: "We need to continue to ensure that Thames Water is an organisation that both customers and staff feel proud of."</p>
<p>The future of the water industry has recently become a hot political issue, with Labour saying it would take it back into public ownership if elected.</p>
<p>Water firms were sold off by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1989.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">The first black female director in competition at the Cannes Film Festival has said she was inspired by her "need to see black people on screen".</p>
<p>French-Senegalese star Mati Diop made history on Thursday when Atlantics became the first film made by a woman of African descent to be screened in the event's 72 year history.</p>
<p>Diop revealed she was "moved" but also "a little sad" at the achievement.</p>
<p>"It's pretty late and it's incredible that it is still relevant," she said.</p>
<p>"My first feeling to be the first black female director was a little sadness that this only happened today in 2019.</p>

<p>Actor Ibrahima Mbaye, who plays a troubled local detective, joked that he thought the film would only reach as far as Senegalese TV. </p>
<p>Diop hopes her historic feat will afford more black women the opportunity to bring their stories to the silver screen.</p>
<p>"When you feel your own little story meets the bigger story the feeling is that it doesn't belong to you, which is quite moving really.</p>
<p>"I'm a bit sceptical towards 'proudness' towards identity.</p>
<p>"But if for some young black female film directors I can represent a new dynamic, I'm obviously extremely happy."</p>

<p>The probe, headed by Attorney General William Barr, is examining the origins of the Russia investigation.</p>
<p>It has long been requested by Mr Trump, who often labels the inquiry into Russian interference a "witch hunt".</p>
<p>On Thursday he announced a directive that gave Mr Barr sweeping new powers, including to declassify documents.</p>
<p>Mr Barr is already subject to intense scrutiny and criticism by Democrats - who have accused him of acting on the president's behalf and not in the national interest.</p>

<p>In April, the attorney general told Congress that "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign, and said he wanted to ensure that any intelligence-gathering had been legitimate. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mr Barr assigned a federal prosecutor to look at the origins of the Russia investigation. Mr Trump has denied asking Mr Barr to do so.</p>
<p>Thursday's memorandum directs the heads of intelligence agencies to "promptly provide" information to Mr Barr upon his request.</p>
<p>"Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions," press secretary Sarah Sanders said.</p>
<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">What did the Russia investigation find?</h2>
<p>After almost two years, a redacted version of the report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller was released in April.</p>
<p>The report concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election "in sweeping and systematic fashion" but did not find there had been a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>It did, however, detail 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation.</p>
<p>After the report was released, Mr Barr was accused of mischaracterising its findings in a previously released summary. </p>

<h2 class="story-body__crosshead">An open question</h2>
<p><strong>Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter, BBC News</strong></p>
<p>Now comes the counter-attack</p>
<p>For nearly two years, Donald Trump was buffeted by an investigation into his presidential campaign conducted from within his own justice department. Now that the Robert Mueller inquiry has concluded, the administration's investigatory powers - heralded by the attorney general - are being directed at those who began the investigation.</p>
<p>The president has long railed against the Russia inquiry as an illegitimate hoax designed to "spy" on him and his associates. On Thursday he stood by his accusation that senior intelligence agency officials involved in the investigation had committed "treason" - even after being reminded by a reporter that the punishment for treason is death.</p>
<p>Just what, if anything, Attorney General Barr will unearth with his newly granted powers to request and declassify intelligence agency documents is an open question. He speculated during recent congressional hearings that what the public knows about government surveillance of members of the Trump 2016 campaign team may not be the whole story.</p>
<p>At the very least, however, the president can now claim that he has turned the tables on his long-time antagonists. His supporters will be thrilled. Democrats will call it a distraction. And the political battles rage on.</p>
